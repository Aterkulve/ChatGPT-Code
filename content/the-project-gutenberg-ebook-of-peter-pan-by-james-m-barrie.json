  "Chapter I": "Chapter I. PETER BREAKS THROUGH All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and\r\nthe way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing\r\nin a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I\r\nsuppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand\r\nto her heart and cried, \u201cOh, why can\u2019t you remain like this for\r\never!\u201d This was all that passed between them on the subject, but\r\nhenceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two.\r\nTwo is the beginning of the end. Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.\r\nShe was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her\r\nromantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the\r\npuzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her\r\nsweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there\r\nit was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner. The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when\r\nshe was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran\r\nto her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in\r\nfirst, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the\r\nkiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.\r\nWendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and\r\nthen going off in a passion, slamming the door. Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but\r\nrespected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.\r\nOf course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said\r\nstocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman\r\nrespect him. Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly,\r\nalmost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was\r\nmissing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them\r\nthere were pictures of babies without faces. She drew them when she should have\r\nbeen totting up. They were Mrs. Darling\u2019s guesses. Wendy came first, then John, then Michael. For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able\r\nto keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was frightfully\r\nproud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs.\r\nDarling\u2019s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she\r\nlooked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was\r\nnot his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she\r\nconfused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again. \u201cNow don\u2019t interrupt,\u201d he would beg of her. \u201cI have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can\r\ncut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six,\r\nwith your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in\r\nmy cheque-book makes eight nine seven\u2014who is that moving?\u2014eight\r\nnine seven, dot and carry seven\u2014don\u2019t speak, my own\u2014and the\r\npound you lent to that man who came to the door\u2014quiet, child\u2014dot\r\nand carry child\u2014there, you\u2019ve done it!\u2014did I say nine nine\r\nseven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year\r\non nine nine seven?\u201d \u201cOf course we can, George,\u201d she cried. But she was prejudiced in\r\nWendy\u2019s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two. \u201cRemember mumps,\u201d he warned her almost threateningly, and off he\r\nwent again. \u201cMumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay\r\nit will be more like thirty shillings\u2014don\u2019t speak\u2014measles one\r\nfive, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six\u2014don\u2019t\r\nwaggle your finger\u2014whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings\u201d\u2014and\r\nso on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just\r\ngot through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles\r\ntreated as one. There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower\r\nsqueak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them\r\ngoing in a row to Miss Fulsom\u2019s Kindergarten school, accompanied by their\r\nnurse. Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion\r\nfor being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. As they\r\nwere poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a\r\nprim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular\r\nuntil the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important,\r\nhowever, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens,\r\nwhere she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much\r\nhated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained\r\nof to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How\r\nthorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her\r\ncharges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. She\r\nhad a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and\r\nwhen it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day in\r\nold-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all\r\nthis new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to\r\nsee her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when\r\nthey were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On\r\nJohn\u2019s footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually\r\ncarried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the\r\nbasement of Miss Fulsom\u2019s school where the nurses wait. They sat on\r\nforms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They\r\naffected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she\r\ndespised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs.\r\nDarling\u2019s friends, but if they did come she first whipped off\r\nMichael\u2019s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and\r\nsmoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John\u2019s hair. No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling\r\nknew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked. He had his position in the city to consider. Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she did\r\nnot admire him. \u201cI know she admires you tremendously, George,\u201d Mrs.\r\nDarling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be\r\nspecially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other\r\nservant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in her\r\nlong skirt and maid\u2019s cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she\r\nwould never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was\r\nMrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was\r\nthe kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There never\r\nwas a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan. Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children\u2019s\r\nminds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are\r\nasleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning,\r\nrepacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during\r\nthe day. If you could keep awake (but of course you can\u2019t) you would see\r\nyour own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch\r\nher. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I\r\nexpect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on\r\nearth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,\r\npressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly\r\nstowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and\r\nevil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed\r\nat the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out\r\nyour prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on. I don\u2019t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\u2019s mind.\r\nDoctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become\r\nintensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child\u2019s\r\nmind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are\r\nzigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are\r\nprobably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an\r\nisland, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and\r\nrakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes\r\nwho are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with\r\nsix elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady\r\nwith a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also\r\nfirst day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,\r\nhangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into\r\nbraces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and\r\nso on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing\r\nthrough, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand\r\nstill. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\u2019s, for instance, had a\r\nlagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while\r\nMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John\r\nlived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in\r\na house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had\r\nfriends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the\r\nwhole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a\r\nrow you could say of them that they have each other\u2019s nose, and so forth.\r\nOn these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. We\r\ntoo have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall\r\nland no more. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not\r\nlarge and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and\r\nanother, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and\r\ntable-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you\r\ngo to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in her travels through her children\u2019s minds Mrs. Darling\r\nfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing\r\nwas the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John\r\nand Michael\u2019s minds, while Wendy\u2019s began to be scrawled all over\r\nwith him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and\r\nas Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance. \u201cYes, he is rather cocky,\u201d Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother\r\nhad been questioning her. \u201cBut who is he, my pet?\u201d \u201cHe is Peter Pan, you know, mother.\u201d At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood\r\nshe just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies. There\r\nwere odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way\r\nwith them, so that they should not be frightened. She had believed in him at\r\nthe time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted\r\nwhether there was any such person. \u201cBesides,\u201d she said to Wendy, \u201che would be grown up by this\r\ntime.\u201d \u201cOh no, he isn\u2019t grown up,\u201d Wendy assured her confidently,\r\n\u201cand he is just my size.\u201d She meant that he was her size in both\r\nmind and body; she didn\u2019t know how she knew, she just knew it. Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. \u201cMark my\r\nwords,\u201d he said, \u201cit is some nonsense Nana has been putting into\r\ntheir heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it\r\nwill blow over.\u201d But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite\r\na shock. Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For\r\ninstance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that\r\nwhen they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with\r\nhim. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting\r\nrevelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which\r\ncertainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was\r\npuzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: \u201cI do believe it is that Peter again!\u201d \u201cWhatever do you mean, Wendy?\u201d \u201cIt is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,\u201d Wendy said,\r\nsighing. She was a tidy child. She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes\r\ncame to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on\r\nhis pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn\u2019t know how\r\nshe knew, she just knew. \u201cWhat nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without\r\nknocking.\u201d \u201cI think he comes in by the window,\u201d she said. \u201cMy love, it is three floors up.\u201d \u201cWere not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?\u201d It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window. Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy\r\nthat you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming. \u201cMy child,\u201d the mother cried, \u201cwhy did you not tell me of\r\nthis before?\u201d \u201cI forgot,\u201d said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her\r\nbreakfast. Oh, surely she must have been dreaming. But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them very\r\ncarefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come from\r\nany tree that grew in England. She crawled about the floor, peering at it with\r\na candle for marks of a strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney and\r\ntapped the walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it\r\nwas a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by. Certainly Wendy had been dreaming. But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on\r\nwhich the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun. On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened to\r\nbe Nana\u2019s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them\r\ntill one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep. All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down\r\ntranquilly by the fire to sew. It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The\r\nfire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and\r\npresently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling\u2019s lap. Then her head nodded, oh,\r\nso gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over\r\nthere, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth\r\nnight-light. While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too\r\nnear and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her,\r\nfor she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no\r\nchildren. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in\r\nher dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy\r\nand John and Michael peeping through the gap. The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the\r\nwindow of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He was\r\naccompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about\r\nthe room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that\r\nwakened Mrs. Darling. She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that\r\nhe was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that\r\nhe was very like Mrs. Darling\u2019s kiss. He was a lovely boy, clad in\r\nskeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing\r\nthing about him was that he had all his first teeth. When he saw she was a\r\ngrown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.",
  "Chapter II": "Chapter II. THE SHADOW Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and\r\nNana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy,\r\nwho leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in\r\ndistress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the\r\nstreet to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up,\r\nand in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a\r\nshooting star. She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which\r\nproved to be the boy\u2019s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed\r\nit quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out;\r\nslam went the window and snapped it off. You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite\r\nthe ordinary kind. Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hung\r\nit out at the window, meaning \u201cHe is sure to come back for it; let us put\r\nit where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.\u201d But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it\r\nlooked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thought\r\nof showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John\r\nand Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it\r\nseemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say:\r\n\u201cIt all comes of having a dog for a nurse.\u201d She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until\r\na fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me! The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Of\r\ncourse it was a Friday. \u201cI ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,\u201d she used to\r\nsay afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her,\r\nholding her hand. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Mr. Darling always said, \u201cI am responsible for it\r\nall. I, George Darling, did it. Mea culpa, mea culpa .\u201d He had had\r\na classical education. They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail\r\nof it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the\r\nfaces on a bad coinage. \u201cIf only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,\u201d Mrs.\r\nDarling said. \u201cIf only I had not poured my medicine into Nana\u2019s bowl,\u201d said\r\nMr. Darling. \u201cIf only I had pretended to like the medicine,\u201d was what\r\nNana\u2019s wet eyes said. \u201cMy liking for parties, George.\u201d \u201cMy fatal gift of humour, dearest.\u201d \u201cMy touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.\u201d Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought,\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a\r\nnurse.\u201d Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to\r\nNana\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat fiend!\u201d Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana\u2019s bark was the\r\necho of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\r\nright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names. They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest\r\ndetail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely\r\nlike a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for\r\nMichael\u2019s bath and carrying him to it on her back. \u201cI won\u2019t go to bed,\u201d he had shouted, like one who still\r\nbelieved that he had the last word on the subject, \u201cI won\u2019t, I\r\nwon\u2019t. Nana, it isn\u2019t six o\u2019clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I\r\nshan\u2019t love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won\u2019t be bathed, I\r\nwon\u2019t, I won\u2019t!\u201d Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed\r\nearly because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace\r\nGeorge had given her. She was wearing Wendy\u2019s bracelet on her arm; she\r\nhad asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother. She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the\r\noccasion of Wendy\u2019s birth, and John was saying: \u201cI am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a\r\nmother,\u201d in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the\r\nreal occasion. Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done. Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a\r\nmale, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said\r\nbrutally that they did not want any more. Michael had nearly cried. \u201cNobody wants me,\u201d he said, and of course\r\nthe lady in the evening-dress could not stand that. \u201cI do,\u201d she said, \u201cI so want a third child.\u201d \u201cBoy or girl?\u201d asked Michael, not too hopefully. \u201cBoy.\u201d Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling\r\nand Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael\u2019s\r\nlast night in the nursery. They go on with their recollections. \u201cIt was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Mr.\r\nDarling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado. Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the\r\nparty, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is an\r\nastounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and\r\nshares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him\r\nwithout a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for\r\nthe house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie. This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled\r\nlittle brute of a tie in his hand. \u201cWhy, what is the matter, father dear?\u201d \u201cMatter!\u201d he yelled; he really yelled. \u201cThis tie, it will not\r\ntie.\u201d He became dangerously sarcastic. \u201cNot round my neck! Round\r\nthe bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but\r\nround my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!\u201d He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly,\r\n\u201cI warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we\r\ndon\u2019t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don\u2019t go out to dinner\r\nto-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don\u2019t go to the office\r\nagain, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the\r\nstreets.\u201d Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. \u201cLet me try, dear,\u201d she said,\r\nand indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool\r\nhands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their\r\nfate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily,\r\nbut Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly,\r\nat once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with\r\nMichael on his back. \u201cHow wildly we romped!\u201d says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it. \u201cOur last romp!\u201d Mr. Darling groaned. \u201cO George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, \u2018How did\r\nyou get to know me, mother?\u2019\u201d \u201cI remember!\u201d \u201cThey were rather sweet, don\u2019t you think, George?\u201d \u201cAnd they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.\u201d The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling\r\ncollided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They were not only new\r\ntrousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he\r\nhad had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darling\r\nbrushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog\r\nfor a nurse. \u201cGeorge, Nana is a treasure.\u201d \u201cNo doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the\r\nchildren as puppies.\u201d \u201cOh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.\u201d \u201cI wonder,\u201d Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, \u201cI wonder.\u201d\r\nIt was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first\r\nhe pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the\r\nshadow. \u201cIt is nobody I know,\u201d he said, examining it carefully, \u201cbut\r\nit does look a scoundrel.\u201d \u201cWe were still discussing it, you remember,\u201d says Mr. Darling,\r\n\u201cwhen Nana came in with Michael\u2019s medicine. You will never carry\r\nthe bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.\u201d Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather\r\nfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all\r\nhis life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the\r\nspoon in Nana\u2019s mouth, he had said reprovingly, \u201cBe a man,\r\nMichael.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t; won\u2019t!\u201d Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling\r\nleft the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed\r\nwant of firmness. \u201cMother, don\u2019t pamper him,\u201d he called after her.\r\n\u201cMichael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said,\r\n\u2018Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me\r\nwell.\u2019\u201d He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown,\r\nbelieved it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, \u201cThat medicine you\r\nsometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cEver so much nastier,\u201d Mr. Darling said bravely, \u201cand I\r\nwould take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn\u2019t lost the\r\nbottle.\u201d He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of\r\nthe wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithful\r\nLiza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand. \u201cI know where it is, father,\u201d Wendy cried, always glad to be of\r\nservice. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it,\u201d and she was off before he could\r\nstop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way. \u201cJohn,\u201d he said, shuddering, \u201cit\u2019s most beastly stuff.\r\nIt\u2019s that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.\u201d \u201cIt will soon be over, father,\u201d John said cheerily, and then in\r\nrushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass. \u201cI have been as quick as I could,\u201d she panted. \u201cYou have been wonderfully quick,\u201d her father retorted, with a\r\nvindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. \u201cMichael\r\nfirst,\u201d he said doggedly. \u201cFather first,\u201d said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature. \u201cI shall be sick, you know,\u201d Mr. Darling said threateningly. \u201cCome on, father,\u201d said John. \u201cHold your tongue, John,\u201d his father rapped out. Wendy was quite puzzled. \u201cI thought you took it quite easily,\r\nfather.\u201d \u201cThat is not the point,\u201d he retorted. \u201cThe point is, that\r\nthere is more in my glass than in Michael\u2019s spoon.\u201d His proud heart\r\nwas nearly bursting. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t fair: I would say it though it\r\nwere with my last breath; it isn\u2019t fair.\u201d \u201cFather, I am waiting,\u201d said Michael coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.\u201d \u201cFather\u2019s a cowardly custard.\u201d \u201cSo are you a cowardly custard.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not frightened.\u201d \u201cNeither am I frightened.\u201d \u201cWell, then, take it.\u201d \u201cWell, then, you take it.\u201d Wendy had a splendid idea. \u201cWhy not both take it at the same time?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Mr. Darling. \u201cAre you ready,\r\nMichael?\u201d Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr.\r\nDarling slipped his behind his back. There was a yell of rage from Michael, and \u201cO father!\u201d Wendy\r\nexclaimed. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018O father\u2019?\u201d Mr. Darling demanded.\r\n\u201cStop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I\u2014I missed\r\nit.\u201d It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they did\r\nnot admire him. \u201cLook here, all of you,\u201d he said entreatingly, as\r\nsoon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. \u201cI have just thought of a\r\nsplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana\u2019s bowl, and she will\r\ndrink it, thinking it is milk!\u201d It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father\u2019s\r\nsense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine\r\ninto Nana\u2019s bowl. \u201cWhat fun!\u201d he said doubtfully, and they\r\ndid not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned. \u201cNana, good dog,\u201d he said, patting her, \u201cI have put a little\r\nmilk into your bowl, Nana.\u201d Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gave\r\nMr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear\r\nthat makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel. Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In a\r\nhorrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. \u201cO George,\u201d she said,\r\n\u201cit\u2019s your medicine!\u201d \u201cIt was only a joke,\u201d he roared, while she comforted her boys, and\r\nWendy hugged Nana. \u201cMuch good,\u201d he said bitterly, \u201cmy wearing\r\nmyself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.\u201d And still Wendy hugged Nana. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he shouted.\r\n\u201cCoddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner,\r\nwhy should I be coddled\u2014why, why, why!\u201d \u201cGeorge,\u201d Mrs. Darling entreated him, \u201cnot so loud; the\r\nservants will hear you.\u201d Somehow they had got into the way of calling\r\nLiza the servants. \u201cLet them!\u201d he answered recklessly. \u201cBring in the whole\r\nworld. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour\r\nlonger.\u201d The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. He\r\nfelt he was a strong man again. \u201cIn vain, in vain,\u201d he cried;\r\n\u201cthe proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up\r\nthis instant.\u201d \u201cGeorge, George,\u201d Mrs. Darling whispered, \u201cremember what I\r\ntold you about that boy.\u201d Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in that\r\nhouse, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her out\r\nof it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from the\r\nnursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his\r\ntoo affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her up\r\nin the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his\r\nknuckles to his eyes. In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence\r\nand lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered,\r\n\u201cIt is because he is chaining her up in the yard,\u201d but Wendy was\r\nwiser. \u201cThat is not Nana\u2019s unhappy bark,\u201d she said, little guessing\r\nwhat was about to happen; \u201cthat is her bark when she smells\r\ndanger.\u201d Danger! \u201cAre you sure, Wendy?\u201d \u201cOh, yes.\u201d Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She\r\nlooked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the\r\nhouse, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not\r\nnotice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a\r\nnameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, \u201cOh, how I wish\r\nthat I wasn\u2019t going to a party to-night!\u201d Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked,\r\n\u201cCan anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?\u201d \u201cNothing, precious,\u201d she said; \u201cthey are the eyes a mother\r\nleaves behind her to guard her children.\u201d She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael\r\nflung his arms round her. \u201cMother,\u201d he cried, \u201cI\u2019m glad\r\nof you.\u201d They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long\r\ntime. No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow,\r\nand Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their\r\nshoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were\r\nwatching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in\r\nanything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for\r\nsomething they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older\r\nones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language),\r\nbut the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who\r\nhad a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;\r\nbut they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to\r\nget the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of\r\nall the stars in the Milky Way screamed out: \u201cNow, Peter!\u201d",
  "Chapter III": "Chapter III. COME AWAY, COME AWAY! For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the\r\nbeds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice\r\nlittle night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept\r\nawake to see Peter; but Wendy\u2019s light blinked and gave such a yawn that\r\nthe other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the\r\nthree went out. There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the\r\nnight-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the\r\ndrawers in the nursery, looking for Peter\u2019s shadow, rummaged the wardrobe\r\nand turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made this\r\nlight by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you\r\nsaw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl\r\ncalled Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square,\r\nthrough which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly\r\ninclined to embonpoint . A moment after the fairy\u2019s entrance the window was blown open by the\r\nbreathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried Tinker Bell\r\npart of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust. \u201cTinker Bell,\u201d he called softly, after making sure that the\r\nchildren were asleep, \u201cTink, where are you?\u201d She was in a jug for\r\nthe moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before. \u201cOh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my\r\nshadow?\u201d The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language.\r\nYou ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would\r\nknow that you had heard it once before. Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers,\r\nand Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with\r\nboth hands, as kings toss ha\u2019pence to the crowd. In a moment he had\r\nrecovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell\r\nup in the drawer. If he thought at all, but I don\u2019t believe he ever thought, it was that he\r\nand his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water,\r\nand when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap from\r\nthe bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat\r\non the floor and cried. His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see a\r\nstranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested. \u201cBoy,\u201d she said courteously, \u201cwhy are you crying?\u201d Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy\r\nceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much pleased, and\r\nbowed beautifully to him from the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked. \u201cWendy Moira Angela Darling,\u201d she replied with some satisfaction.\r\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparatively\r\nshort name. \u201cIs that all?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it\r\nwas a shortish name. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d said Wendy Moira Angela. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Peter gulped. She asked where he lived. \u201cSecond to the right,\u201d said Peter, \u201cand then straight on till\r\nmorning.\u201d \u201cWhat a funny address!\u201d Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny\r\naddress. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean,\u201d Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess,\r\n\u201cis that what they put on the letters?\u201d He wished she had not mentioned letters. \u201cDon\u2019t get any letters,\u201d he said contemptuously. \u201cBut your mother gets letters?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t have a mother,\u201d he said. Not only had he no mother,\r\nbut he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very\r\nover-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence\r\nof a tragedy. \u201cO Peter, no wonder you were crying,\u201d she said, and got out of bed\r\nand ran to him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t crying about mothers,\u201d he said rather indignantly.\r\n\u201cI was crying because I can\u2019t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I\r\nwasn\u2019t crying.\u201d \u201cIt has come off?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was\r\nfrightfully sorry for Peter. \u201cHow awful!\u201d she said, but she could\r\nnot help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap.\r\nHow exactly like a boy! Fortunately she knew at once what to do. \u201cIt must be sewn on,\u201d she\r\nsaid, just a little patronisingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s sewn?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re dreadfully ignorant.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d But she was exulting in his ignorance. \u201cI shall sew it on for you, my\r\nlittle man,\u201d she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her\r\nhousewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter\u2019s foot. \u201cI daresay it will hurt a little,\u201d she warned him. \u201cOh, I shan\u2019t cry,\u201d said Peter, who was already of the\r\nopinion that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did\r\nnot cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little\r\ncreased. \u201cPerhaps I should have ironed it,\u201d Wendy said thoughtfully, but\r\nPeter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in\r\nthe wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to\r\nWendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. \u201cHow clever I\r\nam!\u201d he crowed rapturously, \u201coh, the cleverness of me!\u201d It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his\r\nmost fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a\r\ncockier boy. But for the moment Wendy was shocked. \u201cYou conceit,\u201d she exclaimed,\r\nwith frightful sarcasm; \u201cof course I did nothing!\u201d \u201cYou did a little,\u201d Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance. \u201cA little!\u201d she replied with hauteur; \u201cif I am no use I can\r\nat least withdraw,\u201d and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and\r\ncovered her face with the blankets. To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed he\r\nsat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.\r\n\u201cWendy,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t withdraw. I can\u2019t help\r\ncrowing, Wendy, when I\u2019m pleased with myself.\u201d Still she would not\r\nlook up, though she was listening eagerly. \u201cWendy,\u201d he continued,\r\nin a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, \u201cWendy, one\r\ngirl is more use than twenty boys.\u201d Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and\r\nshe peeped out of the bed-clothes. \u201cDo you really think so, Peter?\u201d \u201cYes, I do.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly sweet of you,\u201d she declared,\r\n\u201cand I\u2019ll get up again,\u201d and she sat with him on the side of\r\nthe bed. She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not\r\nknow what she meant, and he held out his hand expectantly. \u201cSurely you know what a kiss is?\u201d she asked, aghast. \u201cI shall know when you give it to me,\u201d he replied stiffly, and not\r\nto hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cshall I give you a kiss?\u201d and she\r\nreplied with a slight primness, \u201cIf you please.\u201d She made herself\r\nrather cheap by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn\r\nbutton into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been\r\nbefore, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her\r\nneck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to\r\nsave her life. When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each\r\nother\u2019s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing,\r\nasked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; it\r\nwas like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked\r\nis Kings of England. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied uneasily, \u201cbut I am quite\r\nyoung.\u201d He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he\r\nsaid at a venture, \u201cWendy, I ran away the day I was born.\u201d Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the charming\r\ndrawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he could sit nearer\r\nher. \u201cIt was because I heard father and mother,\u201d he explained in a low\r\nvoice, \u201ctalking about what I was to be when I became a man.\u201d He was\r\nextraordinarily agitated now. \u201cI don\u2019t want ever to be a\r\nman,\u201d he said with passion. \u201cI want always to be a little boy and\r\nto have fun. So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time\r\namong the fairies.\u201d She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it was\r\nbecause he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies. Wendy had\r\nlived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful. She\r\npoured out questions about them, to his surprise, for they were rather a\r\nnuisance to him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had to\r\ngive them a hiding. Still, he liked them on the whole, and he told her about\r\nthe beginning of fairies. \u201cYou see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its\r\nlaugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that\r\nwas the beginning of fairies.\u201d Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it. \u201cAnd so,\u201d he went on good-naturedly, \u201cthere ought to be one\r\nfairy for every boy and girl.\u201d \u201cOught to be? Isn\u2019t there?\u201d \u201cNo. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don\u2019t believe\r\nin fairies, and every time a child says, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in\r\nfairies,\u2019 there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.\u201d Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck him\r\nthat Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. \u201cI can\u2019t think where she\r\nhas gone to,\u201d he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy\u2019s\r\nheart went flutter with a sudden thrill. \u201cPeter,\u201d she cried, clutching him, \u201cyou don\u2019t mean to\r\ntell me that there is a fairy in this room!\u201d \u201cShe was here just now,\u201d he said a little impatiently. \u201cYou\r\ndon\u2019t hear her, do you?\u201d and they both listened. \u201cThe only sound I hear,\u201d said Wendy, \u201cis like a tinkle of\r\nbells.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s Tink, that\u2019s the fairy language. I think I hear\r\nher too.\u201d The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face. No one\r\ncould ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of gurgles was his\r\nlaugh. He had his first laugh still. \u201cWendy,\u201d he whispered gleefully, \u201cI do believe I shut her up\r\nin the drawer!\u201d He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery screaming\r\nwith fury. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say such things,\u201d Peter retorted.\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the\r\ndrawer?\u201d Wendy was not listening to him. \u201cO Peter,\u201d she cried, \u201cif she\r\nwould only stand still and let me see her!\u201d \u201cThey hardly ever stand still,\u201d he said, but for one moment Wendy\r\nsaw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. \u201cO the\r\nlovely!\u201d she cried, though Tink\u2019s face was still distorted with\r\npassion. \u201cTink,\u201d said Peter amiably, \u201cthis lady says she wishes you\r\nwere her fairy.\u201d Tinker Bell answered insolently. \u201cWhat does she say, Peter?\u201d He had to translate. \u201cShe is not very polite. She says you are a great\r\nugly girl, and that she is my fairy.\u201d He tried to argue with Tink. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t be my fairy, Tink,\r\nbecause I am an gentleman and you are a lady.\u201d To this Tink replied in these words, \u201cYou silly ass,\u201d and\r\ndisappeared into the bathroom. \u201cShe is quite a common fairy,\u201d Peter\r\nexplained apologetically, \u201cshe is called Tinker Bell because she mends\r\nthe pots and kettles.\u201d They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him with more\r\nquestions. \u201cIf you don\u2019t live in Kensington Gardens now\u2014\u201d \u201cSometimes I do still.\u201d \u201cBut where do you live mostly now?\u201d \u201cWith the lost boys.\u201d \u201cWho are they?\u201d \u201cThey are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse\r\nis looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent\r\nfar away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I\u2019m captain.\u201d \u201cWhat fun it must be!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said cunning Peter, \u201cbut we are rather lonely. You see\r\nwe have no female companionship.\u201d \u201cAre none of the others girls?\u201d \u201cOh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their\r\nprams.\u201d This flattered Wendy immensely. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cit is\r\nperfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises\r\nus.\u201d For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick.\r\nThis seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him with\r\nspirit that he was not captain in her house. However, John continued to sleep\r\nso placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there. \u201cAnd I\r\nknow you meant to be kind,\u201d she said, relenting, \u201cso you may give\r\nme a kiss.\u201d For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. \u201cI thought\r\nyou would want it back,\u201d he said a little bitterly, and offered to return\r\nher the thimble. \u201cOh dear,\u201d said the nice Wendy, \u201cI don\u2019t mean a kiss, I\r\nmean a thimble.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cFunny!\u201d said Peter gravely. \u201cNow shall I give you a\r\nthimble?\u201d \u201cIf you wish to,\u201d said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time. Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. \u201cWhat is it,\r\nWendy?\u201d \u201cIt was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.\u201d \u201cThat must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.\u201d And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language. \u201cShe says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a\r\nthimble.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cWhy, Tink?\u201d Again Tink replied, \u201cYou silly ass.\u201d Peter could not understand\r\nwhy, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he\r\nadmitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to\r\nstories. \u201cYou see, I don\u2019t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any\r\nstories.\u201d \u201cHow perfectly awful,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cDo you know,\u201d Peter asked \u201cwhy swallows build in the eaves\r\nof houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you\r\nsuch a lovely story.\u201d \u201cWhich story was it?\u201d \u201cAbout the prince who couldn\u2019t find the lady who wore the glass\r\nslipper.\u201d \u201cPeter,\u201d said Wendy excitedly, \u201cthat was Cinderella, and he\r\nfound her, and they lived happily ever after.\u201d Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, and\r\nhurried to the window. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she cried with misgiving. \u201cTo tell the other boys.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go Peter,\u201d she entreated, \u201cI know such lots of\r\nstories.\u201d Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she who\r\nfirst tempted him. He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have\r\nalarmed her, but did not. \u201cOh, the stories I could tell to the boys!\u201d she cried, and then\r\nPeter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window. \u201cLet me go!\u201d she ordered him. \u201cWendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.\u201d Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, \u201cOh dear, I\r\ncan\u2019t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can\u2019t fly.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d \u201cOh, how lovely to fly.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to jump on the wind\u2019s back, and then away\r\nwe go.\u201d \u201cOo!\u201d she exclaimed rapturously. \u201cWendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be\r\nflying about with me saying funny things to the stars.\u201d \u201cOo!\u201d \u201cAnd, Wendy, there are mermaids.\u201d \u201cMermaids! With tails?\u201d \u201cSuch long tails.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d cried Wendy, \u201cto see a mermaid!\u201d He had become frightfully cunning. \u201cWendy,\u201d he said, \u201chow we\r\nshould all respect you.\u201d She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying to\r\nremain on the nursery floor. But he had no pity for her. \u201cWendy,\u201d he said, the sly one, \u201cyou could tuck us in at\r\nnight.\u201d \u201cOo!\u201d \u201cNone of us has ever been tucked in at night.\u201d \u201cOo,\u201d and her arms went out to him. \u201cAnd you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has\r\nany pockets.\u201d How could she resist. \u201cOf course it\u2019s awfully fascinating!\u201d\r\nshe cried. \u201cPeter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?\u201d \u201cIf you like,\u201d he said indifferently, and she ran to John and\r\nMichael and shook them. \u201cWake up,\u201d she cried, \u201cPeter Pan has\r\ncome and he is to teach us to fly.\u201d John rubbed his eyes. \u201cThen I shall get up,\u201d he said. Of course he\r\nwas on the floor already. \u201cHallo,\u201d he said, \u201cI am up!\u201d Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades\r\nand a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awful\r\ncraftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was as\r\nstill as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana,\r\nwho had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her\r\nsilence they had heard. \u201cOut with the light! Hide! Quick!\u201d cried John, taking command for\r\nthe only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,\r\nholding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would\r\nhave sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they\r\nslept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains. Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the\r\nkitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by\r\nNana\u2019s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little\r\nquiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course. \u201cThere, you suspicious brute,\u201d she said, not sorry that Nana was in\r\ndisgrace. \u201cThey are perfectly safe, aren\u2019t they? Every one of the\r\nlittle angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.\u201d Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they were\r\nnearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to drag\r\nherself out of Liza\u2019s clutches. But Liza was dense. \u201cNo more of it, Nana,\u201d she said sternly,\r\npulling her out of the room. \u201cI warn you if you bark again I shall go\r\nstraight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then,\r\noh, won\u2019t master whip you, just.\u201d She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bring\r\nmaster and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she wanted. Do\r\nyou think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe?\r\nUnfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help\r\nwould come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke\r\nit. In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her\r\npaws to heaven, her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nDarling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,\r\nand without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street. But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the\r\ncurtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes. We now return to the nursery. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d John announced, emerging from his\r\nhiding-place. \u201cI say, Peter, can you really fly?\u201d Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking the\r\nmantelpiece on the way. \u201cHow topping!\u201d said John and Michael. \u201cHow sweet!\u201d cried Wendy. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sweet, oh, I am sweet!\u201d said Peter, forgetting his\r\nmanners again. It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then\r\nfrom the beds, but they always went down instead of up. \u201cI say, how do you do it?\u201d asked John, rubbing his knee. He was\r\nquite a practical boy. \u201cYou just think lovely wonderful thoughts,\u201d Peter explained,\r\n\u201cand they lift you up in the air.\u201d He showed them again. \u201cYou\u2019re so nippy at it,\u201d John said, \u201ccouldn\u2019t you\r\ndo it very slowly once?\u201d Peter did it both slowly and quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve got it now,\r\nWendy!\u201d cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could\r\nfly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did\r\nnot know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the\r\nfairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his\r\nhands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb\r\nresults. \u201cNow just wiggle your shoulders this way,\u201d he said, \u201cand let\r\ngo.\u201d They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quite\r\nmean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room. \u201cI flewed!\u201d he screamed while still in mid-air. John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom. \u201cOh, lovely!\u201d \u201cOh, ripping!\u201d \u201cLook at me!\u201d \u201cLook at me!\u201d \u201cLook at me!\u201d They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little,\r\nbut their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing\r\nso delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink\r\nwas so indignant. Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy\u2019s word. \u201cI say,\u201d cried John, \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t we all go\r\nout?\u201d Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them. Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles.\r\nBut Wendy hesitated. \u201cMermaids!\u201d said Peter again. \u201cOo!\u201d \u201cAnd there are pirates.\u201d \u201cPirates,\u201d cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, \u201clet us go at\r\nonce.\u201d It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of\r\n27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window;\r\nand, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most\r\nheart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain three\r\nlittle figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor but\r\nin the air. Not three figures, four! In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed\r\nupstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to make her\r\nheart go softly. Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and we\r\nshall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other\r\nhand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right\r\nin the end. They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little\r\nstars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that\r\nsmallest star of all called out: \u201cCave, Peter!\u201d Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. \u201cCome,\u201d he\r\ncried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and\r\nMichael and Wendy. Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were\r\nflown.",
  "Chapter IV": "Chapter IV. THE FLIGHT \u201cSecond to the right, and straight on till morning.\u201d That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds,\r\ncarrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it\r\nwith these instructions. Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his\r\nhead. At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights\r\nof flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall\r\nobjects on the way that took their fancy. John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start. They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves\r\nfine fellows for being able to fly round a room. Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before this\r\nthought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their second sea\r\nand their third night. Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and\r\nagain too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely\r\npretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way was\r\nto pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it\r\nfrom them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all\r\ngo chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions\r\nof good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to\r\nknow that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even\r\nthat there are other ways. Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a\r\ndanger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful thing was\r\nthat Peter thought this funny. \u201cThere he goes again!\u201d he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly\r\ndropped like a stone. \u201cSave him, save him!\u201d cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel\r\nsea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael\r\njust before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but\r\nhe always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that\r\ninterested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety,\r\nand the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him,\r\nso there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let\r\nyou go. He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and\r\nfloating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if you\r\ngot behind him and blew he went faster. \u201cDo be more polite to him,\u201d Wendy whispered to John, when they were\r\nplaying \u201cFollow my Leader.\u201d \u201cThen tell him to stop showing off,\u201d said John. When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch\r\neach shark\u2019s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your\r\nfinger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much\r\nsuccess, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept\r\nlooking behind to see how many tails they missed. \u201cYou must be nice to him,\u201d Wendy impressed on her brothers.\r\n\u201cWhat could we do if he were to leave us!\u201d \u201cWe could go back,\u201d Michael said. \u201cHow could we ever find our way back without him?\u201d \u201cWell, then, we could go on,\u201d said John. \u201cThat is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we\r\ndon\u2019t know how to stop.\u201d This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop. John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go\r\nstraight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to\r\ntheir own window. \u201cAnd who is to get food for us, John?\u201d \u201cI nipped a bit out of that eagle\u2019s mouth pretty neatly,\r\nWendy.\u201d \u201cAfter the twentieth try,\u201d Wendy reminded him. \u201cAnd even\r\nthough we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and\r\nthings if he is not near to give us a hand.\u201d Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they\r\nstill kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more\r\nthey tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had\r\nbeen with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael\u2019s forehead by\r\nthis time. Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by\r\nthemselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot\r\nout of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come\r\ndown laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but\r\nhe had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales\r\nstill sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been\r\nhappening. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a\r\nmermaid. \u201cAnd if he forgets them so quickly,\u201d Wendy argued, \u201chow can\r\nwe expect that he will go on remembering us?\u201d Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well.\r\nWendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to\r\npass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name. \u201cI\u2019m Wendy,\u201d she said agitatedly. He was very sorry. \u201cI say, Wendy,\u201d he whispered to her,\r\n\u201calways if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying\r\n\u2018I\u2019m Wendy,\u2019 and then I\u2019ll remember.\u201d Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed\r\nthem how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this\r\nwas such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they\r\ncould sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter\r\ntired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice,\r\n\u201cWe get off here.\u201d So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole\r\nrollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach\r\nit, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not\r\nperhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island\r\nwas looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic\r\nshores. \u201cThere it is,\u201d said Peter calmly. \u201cWhere, where?\u201d \u201cWhere all the arrows are pointing.\u201d Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all\r\ndirected by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their way\r\nbefore leaving them for the night. Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sight\r\nof the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fear\r\nfell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at\r\nlast, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the\r\nholidays. \u201cJohn, there\u2019s the lagoon.\u201d \u201cWendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.\u201d \u201cI say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!\u201d \u201cLook, Michael, there\u2019s your cave!\u201d \u201cJohn, what\u2019s that in the brushwood?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that\u2019s your\r\nlittle whelp!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!\u201d \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. Why, we burned your boat.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the\r\nredskin camp!\u201d \u201cWhere? Show me, and I\u2019ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether\r\nthey are on the war-path.\u201d \u201cThere, just across the Mysterious River.\u201d \u201cI see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.\u201d Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he wanted to\r\nlord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anon\r\nfear fell upon them? It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom. In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark\r\nand threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread,\r\nblack shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite\r\ndifferent now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win. You\r\nwere quite glad that the night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say that\r\nthis was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all\r\nmake-believe. Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real\r\nnow, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment,\r\nand where was Nana? They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His careless\r\nmanner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through\r\nthem every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island,\r\nflying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was\r\nvisible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as\r\nif they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in\r\nthe air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us to land,\u201d he explained. \u201cWho are they?\u201d Wendy whispered, shuddering. But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder,\r\nbut now he wakened her and sent her on in front. Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to\r\nhis ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to\r\nbore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again. His courage was almost appalling. \u201cWould you like an adventure\r\nnow,\u201d he said casually to John, \u201cor would you like to have your tea\r\nfirst?\u201d Wendy said \u201ctea first\u201d quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in\r\ngratitude, but the braver John hesitated. \u201cWhat kind of adventure?\u201d he asked cautiously. \u201cThere\u2019s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,\u201d\r\nPeter told him. \u201cIf you like, we\u2019ll go down and kill him.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see him,\u201d John said after a long pause. \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cSuppose,\u201d John said, a little huskily, \u201che were to wake\r\nup.\u201d Peter spoke indignantly. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I would kill him while he\r\nwas sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That\u2019s the way I\r\nalways do.\u201d \u201cI say! Do you kill many?\u201d \u201cTons.\u201d John said \u201cHow ripping,\u201d but decided to have tea first. He asked if\r\nthere were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had never\r\nknown so many. \u201cWho is captain now?\u201d \u201cHook,\u201d answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said\r\nthat hated word. \u201cJas. Hook?\u201d \u201cAy.\u201d Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, for\r\nthey knew Hook\u2019s reputation. \u201cHe was Blackbeard\u2019s bo\u2019sun,\u201d John whispered huskily.\r\n\u201cHe is the worst of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was\r\nafraid.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d said Peter. \u201cWhat is he like? Is he big?\u201d \u201cHe is not so big as he was.\u201d \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d \u201cI cut off a bit of him.\u201d \u201cYou!\u201d \u201cYes, me,\u201d said Peter sharply. \u201cI wasn\u2019t meaning to be disrespectful.\u201d \u201cOh, all right.\u201d \u201cBut, I say, what bit?\u201d \u201cHis right hand.\u201d \u201cThen he can\u2019t fight now?\u201d \u201cOh, can\u2019t he just!\u201d \u201cLeft-hander?\u201d \u201cHe has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with\r\nit.\u201d \u201cClaws!\u201d \u201cI say, John,\u201d said Peter. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cSay, \u2018Ay, ay, sir.\u2019\u201d \u201cAy, ay, sir.\u201d \u201cThere is one thing,\u201d Peter continued, \u201cthat every boy who\r\nserves under me has to promise, and so must you.\u201d John paled. \u201cIt is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to\r\nme.\u201d \u201cI promise,\u201d John said loyally. For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them,\r\nand in her light they could distinguish each other. Unfortunately she could not\r\nfly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in\r\nwhich they moved as in a halo. Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out\r\nthe drawbacks. \u201cShe tells me,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the pirates sighted us before\r\nthe darkness came, and got Long Tom out.\u201d \u201cThe big gun?\u201d \u201cYes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are\r\nnear it they are sure to let fly.\u201d \u201cWendy!\u201d \u201cJohn!\u201d \u201cMichael!\u201d \u201cTell her to go away at once, Peter,\u201d the three cried\r\nsimultaneously, but he refused. \u201cShe thinks we have lost the way,\u201d he replied stiffly, \u201cand\r\nshe is rather frightened. You don\u2019t think I would send her away all by\r\nherself when she is frightened!\u201d For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a loving\r\nlittle pinch. \u201cThen tell her,\u201d Wendy begged, \u201cto put out her light.\u201d \u201cShe can\u2019t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies\r\ncan\u2019t do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the\r\nstars.\u201d \u201cThen tell her to sleep at once,\u201d John almost ordered. \u201cShe can\u2019t sleep except when she\u2019s sleepy. It is the only\r\nother thing fairies can\u2019t do.\u201d \u201cSeems to me,\u201d growled John, \u201cthese are the only two things\r\nworth doing.\u201d Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one. \u201cIf only one of us had a pocket,\u201d Peter said, \u201cwe could carry\r\nher in it.\u201d However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not\r\na pocket between the four of them. He had a happy idea. John\u2019s hat! Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it,\r\nthough she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat,\r\nbecause John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall\r\nsee, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy. In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in\r\nsilence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a\r\ndistant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the\r\nford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees\r\nrubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives. Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. \u201cIf\r\nonly something would make a sound!\u201d he cried. As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crash\r\nhe had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them. The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry\r\nsavagely, \u201cWhere are they, where are they, where are they?\u201d Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of\r\nmake-believe and the same island come true. When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves\r\nalone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael\r\nwithout knowing how to float was floating. \u201cAre you shot?\u201d John whispered tremulously. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried yet,\u201d Michael whispered back. We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the\r\nwind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards with no\r\ncompanion but Tinker Bell. It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat. I don\u2019t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had\r\nplanned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure\r\nWendy to her destruction. Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the other\r\nhand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other,\r\nbecause being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a\r\ntime. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change.\r\nAt present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely\r\ntinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad\r\nwords, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning\r\n\u201cFollow me, and all will be well.\u201d What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael, and\r\ngot only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink hated her with\r\nthe fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered, and now staggering in\r\nher flight, she followed Tink to her doom.",
  "Chapter V": "Chapter V. THE ISLAND COME TRUE Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life.\r\nWe ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was\r\nalways used by Peter. In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour\r\nlonger in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed\r\nheavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they\r\nmerely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates\r\nlethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you\r\nwould hear the whole island seething with life. On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The\r\nlost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lost\r\nboys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out\r\nlooking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but they\r\ndid not meet because all were going at the same rate. All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were out\r\nto greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers,\r\naccording as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up,\r\nwhich is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were\r\nsix of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the\r\nsugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his hand\r\non his dagger. They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear the\r\nskins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furry\r\nthat when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very sure-footed. The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate of\r\nall that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them,\r\nbecause the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the\r\ncorner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off to\r\ngather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would be\r\nsweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his\r\ncountenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was\r\nquite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air\r\nfor you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if\r\naccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent\r\non mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks you are the most\r\neasily tricked of the boys. \u2019Ware Tinker Bell. Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he passes\r\nby, biting his knuckles. Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistles\r\nout of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the most\r\nconceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, with\r\ntheir manners and customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly\r\nis fourth; he is a pickle, and so often has he had to deliver up his person\r\nwhen Peter said sternly, \u201cStand forth the one who did this thing,\u201d\r\nthat now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or\r\nnot. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to\r\nbe describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his\r\nband were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two were\r\nalways vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by\r\nkeeping close together in an apologetic sort of way. The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for\r\nthings go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear them\r\nbefore they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song: \u201cAvast belay, yo ho, heave to, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0A-pirating we go, And if we\u2019re parted by a shot \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We\u2019re sure to meet below!\u201d A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a\r\nlittle in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, his\r\ngreat arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome\r\nItalian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor\r\nof the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since\r\nhe dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the\r\nbanks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the\r\nsame Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the Walrus from Flint before he\r\nwould drop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy\u2019s\r\nbrother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a\r\npublic school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights\r\n(Morgan\u2019s Skylights); and the Irish bo\u2019sun Smee, an oddly genial\r\nman who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist\r\nin Hook\u2019s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and\r\nRobt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on\r\nthe Spanish Main. In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined\r\nJames Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the\r\nonly man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn\r\nand propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with\r\nwhich ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this\r\nterrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person\r\nhe was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,\r\nwhich at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly\r\nthreatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue\r\nof the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging\r\nhis hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up\r\nhorribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so\r\nthat he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a raconteur of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most\r\npolite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his\r\ndiction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his\r\ndemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of\r\nindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight\r\nof his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress he\r\nsomewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard\r\nit said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance\r\nto the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own\r\ncontrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the\r\ngrimmest part of him was his iron claw. Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook\u2019s method. Skylights will do. As\r\nthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar;\r\nthe hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body\r\nis kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from\r\nhis mouth. Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win? On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is\r\nnot visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them with\r\nhis eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam\r\nwith paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of\r\npirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the\r\nsofter-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big\r\nLittle Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they\r\nsomewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest\r\ndanger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is\r\nthe most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,\r\ncoquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would not have\r\nthe wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe\r\nhow they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only\r\nsound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are\r\nall a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work\r\nthis off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger. The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place is\r\ntaken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and\r\nthe innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of\r\nbeast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the\r\nfavoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night. When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. We\r\nshall see for whom she is looking presently. The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must\r\ncontinue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. Then\r\nquickly they will be on top of each other. All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger\r\nmay be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island was. The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselves\r\ndown on the sward, close to their underground home. \u201cI do wish Peter would come back,\u201d every one of them said\r\nnervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than\r\ntheir captain. \u201cI am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,\u201d Slightly\r\nsaid, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps\r\nsome distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, \u201cbut I wish he\r\nwould come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about\r\nCinderella.\u201d They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must have\r\nbeen very like her. It was only in Peter\u2019s absence that they could speak of mothers, the\r\nsubject being forbidden by him as silly. \u201cAll I remember about my mother,\u201d Nibs told them, \u201cis that\r\nshe often said to my father, \u2018Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my\r\nown!\u2019 I don\u2019t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to\r\ngive my mother one.\u201d While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild things\r\nof the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grim\r\nsong: \u201cYo ho, yo ho, the pirate life, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The flag o\u2019 skull and bones, A merry hour, a hempen rope, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0And hey for Davy Jones.\u201d At once the lost boys\u2014but where are they? They are no longer there.\r\nRabbits could not have disappeared more quickly. I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away\r\nto reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the ground, a very\r\ndelightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how have\r\nthey reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large\r\nstone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely,\r\nhowever, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a\r\nhole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to\r\nthe home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many\r\nmoons. Will he find it tonight? As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing\r\nthrough the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But an iron claw gripped\r\nhis shoulder. \u201cCaptain, let go!\u201d he cried, writhing. Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.\r\n\u201cPut back that pistol first,\u201d it said threateningly. \u201cIt was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.\u201d \u201cAy, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily\u2019s redskins upon\r\nus. Do you want to lose your scalp?\u201d \u201cShall I after him, Captain,\u201d asked pathetic Smee, \u201cand\r\ntickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?\u201d Smee had pleasant names for\r\neverything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the\r\nwound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after\r\nkilling, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon. \u201cJohnny\u2019s a silent fellow,\u201d he reminded Hook. \u201cNot now, Smee,\u201d Hook said darkly. \u201cHe is only one, and I\r\nwant to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.\u201d The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee\r\nwere alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was\r\nbecause of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to\r\nconfide to his faithful bo\u2019sun the story of his life. He spoke long and\r\nearnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know\r\nin the least. Anon he caught the word Peter. \u201cMost of all,\u201d Hook was saying passionately, \u201cI want their\r\ncaptain, Peter Pan. \u2019Twas he cut off my arm.\u201d He brandished the\r\nhook threateningly. \u201cI\u2019ve waited long to shake his hand with this.\r\nOh, I\u2019ll tear him!\u201d \u201cAnd yet,\u201d said Smee, \u201cI have often heard you say that hook\r\nwas worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.\u201d \u201cAy,\u201d the captain answered, \u201cif I was a mother I would pray\r\nto have my children born with this instead of that,\u201d and he cast a look\r\nof pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he\r\nfrowned. \u201cPeter flung my arm,\u201d he said, wincing, \u201cto a crocodile that\r\nhappened to be passing by.\u201d \u201cI have often,\u201d said Smee, \u201cnoticed your strange dread of\r\ncrocodiles.\u201d \u201cNot of crocodiles,\u201d Hook corrected him, \u201cbut of that one\r\ncrocodile.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cIt liked my arm so much, Smee,\r\nthat it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land,\r\nlicking its lips for the rest of me.\u201d \u201cIn a way,\u201d said Smee, \u201cit\u2019s sort of a\r\ncompliment.\u201d \u201cI want no such compliments,\u201d Hook barked petulantly. \u201cI want\r\nPeter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.\u201d He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his voice.\r\n\u201cSmee,\u201d he said huskily, \u201cthat crocodile would have had me\r\nbefore this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick\r\ninside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.\u201d He\r\nlaughed, but in a hollow way. \u201cSome day,\u201d said Smee, \u201cthe clock will run down, and then\r\nhe\u2019ll get you.\u201d Hook wetted his dry lips. \u201cAy,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s the\r\nfear that haunts me.\u201d Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. \u201cSmee,\u201d he said,\r\n\u201cthis seat is hot.\u201d He jumped up. \u201cOdds bobs, hammer and\r\ntongs I\u2019m burning.\u201d They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the\r\nmainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands,\r\nfor it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates\r\nlooked at each other. \u201cA chimney!\u201d they both exclaimed. They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was the\r\ncustom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the\r\nneighbourhood. Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children\u2019s voices, for so\r\nsafe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering.\r\nThe pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around\r\nthem and noted the holes in the seven trees. \u201cDid you hear them say Peter Pan\u2019s from home?\u201d Smee\r\nwhispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew. Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling\r\nsmile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it. \u201cUnrip your\r\nplan, captain,\u201d he cried eagerly. \u201cTo return to the ship,\u201d Hook replied slowly through his teeth,\r\n\u201cand cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.\r\nThere can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles\r\nhad not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they\r\nhave no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids\u2019\r\nLagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids.\r\nThey will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother,\r\nthey don\u2019t know how dangerous \u2019tis to eat rich damp cake.\u201d He\r\nburst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. \u201cAha,\r\nthey will die.\u201d Smee had listened with growing admiration. \u201cIt\u2019s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!\u201d he\r\ncried, and in their exultation they danced and sang: \u201cAvast, belay, when I appear, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0By fear they\u2019re overtook; Nought\u2019s left upon your bones when you \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Have shaken claws with Hook.\u201d They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke in\r\nand stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have\r\nfallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct. Tick tick tick tick! Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air. \u201cThe crocodile!\u201d he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his\r\nbo\u2019sun. It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on the\r\ntrail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook. Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were not\r\nyet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by a\r\npack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying of\r\nthem was horrible. \u201cSave me, save me!\u201d cried Nibs, falling on the ground. \u201cBut what can we do, what can we do?\u201d It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts\r\nturned to him. \u201cWhat would Peter do?\u201d they cried simultaneously. Almost in the same breath they cried, \u201cPeter would look at them through\r\nhis legs.\u201d And then, \u201cLet us do what Peter would do.\u201d It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy they bent\r\nand looked through their legs. The next moment is the long one, but victory\r\ncame quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude, the\r\nwolves dropped their tails and fled. Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring eyes\r\nstill saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw. \u201cI have seen a wonderfuller thing,\u201d he cried, as they gathered\r\nround him eagerly. \u201cA great white bird. It is flying this way.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a bird, do you think?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nibs said, awestruck, \u201cbut it looks so\r\nweary, and as it flies it moans, \u2018Poor Wendy.\u2019\u201d \u201cPoor Wendy?\u201d \u201cI remember,\u201d said Slightly instantly, \u201cthere are birds\r\ncalled Wendies.\u201d \u201cSee, it comes!\u201d cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens. Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry. But more\r\ndistinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous fairy had now cast\r\noff all disguise of friendship, and was darting at her victim from every\r\ndirection, pinching savagely each time she touched. \u201cHullo, Tink,\u201d cried the wondering boys. Tink\u2019s reply rang out: \u201cPeter wants you to shoot the Wendy.\u201d It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. \u201cLet us do\r\nwhat Peter wishes!\u201d cried the simple boys. \u201cQuick, bows and\r\narrows!\u201d All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with him, and\r\nTink noted it, and rubbed her little hands. \u201cQuick, Tootles, quick,\u201d she screamed. \u201cPeter will be so\r\npleased.\u201d Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. \u201cOut of the way,\r\nTink,\u201d he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground\r\nwith an arrow in her breast.",
  "Chapter VI": "Chapter VI. THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy\u2019s body when the\r\nother boys sprang, armed, from their trees. \u201cYou are too late,\u201d he cried proudly, \u201cI have shot the Wendy.\r\nPeter will be so pleased with me.\u201d Overhead Tinker Bell shouted \u201cSilly ass!\u201d and darted into hiding.\r\nThe others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they looked a\r\nterrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy\u2019s heart had been beating\r\nthey would all have heard it. Slightly was the first to speak. \u201cThis is no bird,\u201d he said in a\r\nscared voice. \u201cI think this must be a lady.\u201d \u201cA lady?\u201d said Tootles, and fell a-trembling. \u201cAnd we have killed her,\u201d Nibs said hoarsely. They all whipped off their caps. \u201cNow I see,\u201d Curly said: \u201cPeter was bringing her to\r\nus.\u201d He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground. \u201cA lady to take care of us at last,\u201d said one of the twins,\r\n\u201cand you have killed her!\u201d They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a step\r\nnearer them they turned from him. Tootles\u2019 face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that\r\nhad never been there before. \u201cI did it,\u201d he said, reflecting. \u201cWhen ladies used to come to\r\nme in dreams, I said, \u2018Pretty mother, pretty mother.\u2019 But when at\r\nlast she really came, I shot her.\u201d He moved slowly away. \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d they called in pity. \u201cI must,\u201d he answered, shaking; \u201cI am so afraid of\r\nPeter.\u201d It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of\r\nevery one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow. \u201cPeter!\u201d they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his\r\nreturn. \u201cHide her,\u201d they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But\r\nTootles stood aloof. Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.\r\n\u201cGreetings, boys,\u201d he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and\r\nthen again was silence. He frowned. \u201cI am back,\u201d he said hotly, \u201cwhy do you not cheer?\u201d They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked it in\r\nhis haste to tell the glorious tidings. \u201cGreat news, boys,\u201d he cried, \u201cI have brought at last a\r\nmother for you all.\u201d Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees. \u201cHave you not seen her?\u201d asked Peter, becoming troubled. \u201cShe\r\nflew this way.\u201d \u201cAh me!\u201d one voice said, and another said, \u201cOh, mournful\r\nday.\u201d Tootles rose. \u201cPeter,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI will show her to\r\nyou,\u201d and when the others would still have hidden her he said,\r\n\u201cBack, twins, let Peter see.\u201d So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a little\r\ntime he did not know what to do next. \u201cShe is dead,\u201d he said uncomfortably. \u201cPerhaps she is\r\nfrightened at being dead.\u201d He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of\r\nher, and then never going near the spot any more. They would all have been glad\r\nto follow if he had done this. But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band. \u201cWhose arrow?\u201d he demanded sternly. \u201cMine, Peter,\u201d said Tootles on his knees. \u201cOh, dastard hand,\u201d Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it\r\nas a dagger. Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. \u201cStrike, Peter,\u201d he\r\nsaid firmly, \u201cstrike true.\u201d Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. \u201cI cannot\r\nstrike,\u201d he said with awe, \u201cthere is something stays my\r\nhand.\u201d All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy. \u201cIt is she,\u201d he cried, \u201cthe Wendy lady, see, her arm!\u201d Wonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and listened\r\nreverently. \u201cI think she said, \u2018Poor Tootles,\u2019\u201d he\r\nwhispered. \u201cShe lives,\u201d Peter said briefly. Slightly cried instantly, \u201cThe Wendy lady lives.\u201d Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had put it\r\non a chain that she wore round her neck. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201cthe arrow struck against this. It is the\r\nkiss I gave her. It has saved her life.\u201d \u201cI remember kisses,\u201d Slightly interposed quickly, \u201clet me see\r\nit. Ay, that\u2019s a kiss.\u201d Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so that he\r\ncould show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet, being still in\r\na frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note. \u201cListen to Tink,\u201d said Curly, \u201cshe is crying because the\r\nWendy lives.\u201d Then they had to tell Peter of Tink\u2019s crime, and almost never had they\r\nseen him look so stern. \u201cListen, Tinker Bell,\u201d he cried, \u201cI am your friend no more.\r\nBegone from me for ever.\u201d She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not until\r\nWendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say, \u201cWell, not\r\nfor ever, but for a whole week.\u201d Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh dear no,\r\nnever wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, who\r\nunderstood them best, often cuffed them. But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health? \u201cLet us carry her down into the house,\u201d Curly suggested. \u201cAy,\u201d said Slightly, \u201cthat is what one does with\r\nladies.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d Peter said, \u201cyou must not touch her. It would not\r\nbe sufficiently respectful.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Slightly, \u201cis what I was thinking.\u201d \u201cBut if she lies there,\u201d Tootles said, \u201cshe will die.\u201d \u201cAy, she will die,\u201d Slightly admitted, \u201cbut there is no way\r\nout.\u201d \u201cYes, there is,\u201d cried Peter. \u201cLet us build a little house\r\nround her.\u201d They were all delighted. \u201cQuick,\u201d he ordered them, \u201cbring me\r\neach of you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.\u201d In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding. They\r\nskurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while they\r\nwere at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they dragged along the\r\nground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and\r\nslept again. \u201cJohn, John,\u201d Michael would cry, \u201cwake up! Where is Nana,\r\nJohn, and mother?\u201d And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, \u201cIt is true, we did\r\nfly.\u201d You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter. \u201cHullo, Peter,\u201d they said. \u201cHullo,\u201d replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten\r\nthem. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how\r\nlarge a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a\r\ntable. John and Michael watched him. \u201cIs Wendy asleep?\u201d they asked. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cJohn,\u201d Michael proposed, \u201clet us wake her and get her to\r\nmake supper for us,\u201d but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on\r\ncarrying branches for the building of the house. \u201cLook at them!\u201d he\r\ncried. \u201cCurly,\u201d said Peter in his most captainy voice, \u201csee that\r\nthese boys help in the building of the house.\u201d \u201cAy, ay, sir.\u201d \u201cBuild a house?\u201d exclaimed John. \u201cFor the Wendy,\u201d said Curly. \u201cFor Wendy?\u201d John said, aghast. \u201cWhy, she is only a\r\ngirl!\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d explained Curly, \u201cis why we are her servants.\u201d \u201cYou? Wendy\u2019s servants!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Peter, \u201cand you also. Away with them.\u201d The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.\r\n\u201cChairs and a fender first,\u201d Peter ordered. \u201cThen we shall\r\nbuild a house round them.\u201d \u201cAy,\u201d said Slightly, \u201cthat is how a house is built; it all\r\ncomes back to me.\u201d Peter thought of everything. \u201cSlightly,\u201d he cried, \u201cfetch a\r\ndoctor.\u201d \u201cAy, ay,\u201d said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his\r\nhead. But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing\r\nJohn\u2019s hat and looking solemn. \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d said Peter, going to him, \u201care you a\r\ndoctor?\u201d The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew\r\nit was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same\r\nthing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that they\r\nhad had their dinners. If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles. \u201cYes, my little man,\u201d Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped\r\nknuckles. \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d Peter explained, \u201ca lady lies very ill.\u201d She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her. \u201cTut, tut, tut,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere does she lie?\u201d \u201cIn yonder glade.\u201d \u201cI will put a glass thing in her mouth,\u201d said Slightly, and he\r\nmade-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when the\r\nglass thing was withdrawn. \u201cHow is she?\u201d inquired Peter. \u201cTut, tut, tut,\u201d said Slightly, \u201cthis has cured her.\u201d \u201cI am glad!\u201d Peter cried. \u201cI will call again in the evening,\u201d Slightly said; \u201cgive her\r\nbeef tea out of a cup with a spout to it;\u201d but after he had returned the\r\nhat to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a\r\ndifficulty. In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost\r\neverything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy\u2019s feet. \u201cIf only we knew,\u201d said one, \u201cthe kind of house she likes\r\nbest.\u201d \u201cPeter,\u201d shouted another, \u201cshe is moving in her sleep.\u201d \u201cHer mouth opens,\u201d cried a third, looking respectfully into it.\r\n\u201cOh, lovely!\u201d \u201cPerhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,\u201d said Peter.\r\n\u201cWendy, sing the kind of house you would like to have.\u201d Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing: \u201cI wish I had a pretty house, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The littlest ever seen, With funny little red walls \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0And roof of mossy green.\u201d They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches they\r\nhad brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with\r\nmoss. As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves: \u201cWe\u2019ve built the little walls and roof \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0And made a lovely door, So tell us, mother Wendy, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0What are you wanting more?\u201d To this she answered greedily: \u201cOh, really next I think I\u2019ll have \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Gay windows all about, With roses peeping in, you know, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0And babies peeping out.\u201d With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were the\r\nblinds. But roses\u2014? \u201cRoses,\u201d cried Peter sternly. Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls. Babies? To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again: \u201cWe\u2019ve made the roses peeping out, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The babes are at the door, We cannot make ourselves, you know, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u2019Cos we\u2019ve been made before.\u201d Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his own.\r\nThe house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though,\r\nof course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode up and down, ordering\r\nfinishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes. Just when it seemed\r\nabsolutely finished: \u201cThere\u2019s no knocker on the door,\u201d he said. They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it made an\r\nexcellent knocker. Absolutely finished now, they thought. Not of bit of it. \u201cThere\u2019s no chimney,\u201d Peter said; \u201cwe\r\nmust have a chimney.\u201d \u201cIt certainly does need a chimney,\u201d said John importantly. This\r\ngave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John\u2019s head, knocked out the\r\nbottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to have\r\nsuch a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to\r\ncome out of the hat. Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock. \u201cAll look your best,\u201d Peter warned them; \u201cfirst impressions\r\nare awfully important.\u201d He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all too busy\r\nlooking their best. He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound\r\nto be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openly\r\nsneering. What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a lady,\r\nwhat would she be like? The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off their\r\nhats. She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she would\r\nlook. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d she said. Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. \u201cWendy lady,\u201d\r\nhe said rapidly, \u201cfor you we built this house.\u201d \u201cOh, say you\u2019re pleased,\u201d cried Nibs. \u201cLovely, darling house,\u201d Wendy said, and they were the very words\r\nthey had hoped she would say. \u201cAnd we are your children,\u201d cried the twins. Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, \u201cO Wendy\r\nlady, be our mother.\u201d \u201cOught I?\u201d Wendy said, all shining. \u201cOf course it\u2019s\r\nfrightfully fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real\r\nexperience.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Peter, as if he were the only\r\nperson present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew\r\nleast. \u201cWhat we need is just a nice motherly person.\u201d \u201cOh dear!\u201d Wendy said, \u201cyou see, I feel that is exactly what\r\nI am.\u201d \u201cIt is, it is,\u201d they all cried; \u201cwe saw it at once.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d she said, \u201cI will do my best. Come inside at\r\nonce, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you\r\nto bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.\u201d In they went; I don\u2019t know how there was room for them, but you can\r\nsqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyous\r\nevenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in\r\nthe home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house,\r\nand Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard\r\ncarousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked so\r\ncosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds,\r\nand the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time\r\nhe fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way\r\nhome from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night\r\nthey would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter\u2019s nose and passed\r\non.",
  "Chapter VII": "Chapter VII. THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and\r\nMichael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for\r\nthinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your\r\ntree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were\r\nquite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and\r\ndown you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let\r\nout alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the\r\naction you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing\r\ncan be more graceful. But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as\r\nfor a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to\r\nfit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree. Usually it is done quite\r\neasily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy\r\nin awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some\r\nthings to you, and after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken\r\nto go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a\r\nwhole family in perfect condition. Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be\r\naltered a little. After a few days\u2019 practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets\r\nin a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground;\r\nespecially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with\r\na floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor\r\ngrew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never\r\ntree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed\r\nthe trunk through, level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two\r\nfeet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a\r\ntable; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus\r\nthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was in\r\nalmost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy\r\nstretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. The bed\r\nwas tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly\r\nhalf the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like\r\nsardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave\r\nthe signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also, but\r\nWendy would have a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are,\r\nand the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket. It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an\r\nunderground house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in the\r\nwall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker\r\nBell. It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which\r\nTink, who was most fastidious, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.\r\nNo woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir and\r\nbed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen\r\nMab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what\r\nfruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are\r\nnow only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust\r\nand reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the\r\ncarpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a\r\nchandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit\r\nthe residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as\r\nindeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather\r\nconceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up. I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious\r\nboys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, except\r\nperhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. The\r\ncooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was\r\nnothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came\r\naboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal\r\nor just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter\u2019s whim: he could eat,\r\nreally eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel\r\nstodgy, which is what most children like better than anything else; the next\r\nbest thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during\r\na meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying, but\r\nyou simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were\r\ngetting loose for your tree he let you stodge. Wendy\u2019s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone\r\nto bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and\r\nshe occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the\r\nknees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees. When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in\r\nit, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, \u201cOh dear, I am sure I\r\nsometimes think spinsters are to be envied!\u201d Her face beamed when she exclaimed this. You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she had\r\ncome to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each\r\nother\u2019s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere. As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left\r\nbehind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say\r\nhow time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and\r\nsuns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I am\r\nafraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was\r\nabsolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly\r\nback by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times\r\nwas that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known,\r\nwhile Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.\r\nThese things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried\r\nto fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as\r\nlike as possible to the ones she used to do at school. The other boys thought\r\nthis awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for\r\nthemselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the\r\nquestions she had written on another slate and passed round. They were the most\r\nordinary questions\u2014\u201cWhat was the colour of Mother\u2019s eyes?\r\nWhich was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all\r\nthree questions if possible.\u201d \u201c(A) Write an essay of not less than\r\n40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and\r\nMother compared. Only one of these to be attempted.\u201d Or \u201c(1)\r\nDescribe Mother\u2019s laugh; (2) Describe Father\u2019s laugh; (3) Describe\r\nMother\u2019s Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.\u201d They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not answer\r\nthem you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful what a number of\r\ncrosses even John made. Of course the only boy who replied to every question\r\nwas Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but\r\nhis answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: a\r\nmelancholy thing. Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except Wendy, and\r\nfor another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor\r\nspell; not the smallest word. He was above all that sort of thing. By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was the\r\ncolour of Mother\u2019s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been forgetting,\r\ntoo. Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about\r\nthis time Peter invented, with Wendy\u2019s help, a new game that fascinated\r\nhim enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you\r\nhave been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted in\r\npretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael\r\nhad been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air,\r\npushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed\r\nso much as a grizzly. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight;\r\nhe could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such\r\na comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his\r\nhealth. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him;\r\nand John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would\r\nhave treated them severely. He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely\r\ncertain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it so\r\ncompletely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found\r\nthe body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet\r\nyou could not find the body. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and\r\nthen Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a\r\ndazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however,\r\nmany adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and\r\nthere were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were\r\nin them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a\r\nbook as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we\r\ncan do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The\r\ndifficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the redskins\r\nat Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as\r\nshowing one of Peter\u2019s peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a\r\nfight he would suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in\r\nthe balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,\r\n\u201cI\u2019m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?\u201d And Tootles\r\nanswered, \u201cRedskin; what are you, Nibs?\u201d and Nibs said,\r\n\u201cRedskin; what are you Twin?\u201d and so on; and they were all\r\nredskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real\r\nredskins fascinated by Peter\u2019s methods, agreed to be lost boys for that\r\nonce, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever. The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was\u2014but we have not decided\r\nyet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be\r\nthe night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of\r\nthem stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we might\r\ntell how Peter saved Tiger Lily\u2019s life in the Mermaids\u2019 Lagoon, and\r\nso made her his ally. Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it\r\nand perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but\r\nalways Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it\r\nlost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile,\r\nand Hook fell over it in the dark. Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter\u2019s friends, particularly\r\nof the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest\r\nfell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders\r\nthat she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows how\r\ngrateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure\r\nof the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just\r\none. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell\u2019s\r\nattempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy\r\nconveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave\r\nway and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we\r\nmight choose Peter\u2019s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round\r\nhim on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he\r\nwaited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from\r\ntrees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge. Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss for it. I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that the\r\ngulch or the cake or Tink\u2019s leaf had won. Of course I could do it again,\r\nand make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon.",
  "Chapter VIII": "Chapter VIII. THE MERMAIDS\u2019 LAGOON If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless\r\npool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your\r\neyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid\r\nthat with another squeeze they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire\r\nyou see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland,\r\njust one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf\r\nand hear the mermaids singing. The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating\r\nmost of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. You\r\nmust not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on\r\nthe contrary, it was among Wendy\u2019s lasting regrets that all the time she\r\nwas on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stole\r\nsoftly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on\r\nMarooners\u2019 Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a\r\nlazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it\r\nwere, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably\r\nsplashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally. They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted\r\nwith them on Marooners\u2019 Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when\r\nthey got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs. The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when\r\nthey utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then,\r\nand until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the\r\nlagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied\r\nher, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.\r\nShe was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the\r\nmermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The\r\nbubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them\r\ngaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the\r\nrainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the\r\nkeepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these games\r\nwill be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight. But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves,\r\nfor the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that they\r\nsecretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them;\r\nfor John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of\r\nthe hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left\r\non the Neverland. It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for\r\nhalf an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their doing this, and\r\nit had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So they lay\r\nthere in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them\r\nand looked important. It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners\u2019 Rock. The rock was\r\nnot much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to\r\ntake up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes\r\nshut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She\r\nwas very busy, stitching. While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and\r\nthe sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy\r\ncould no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon\r\nthat had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and\r\nunfriendly. It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had\r\ncome. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent that shiver through\r\nthe sea to say that it was coming. What was it? There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners\u2019\r\nRock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to\r\ndrown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged. Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because of\r\nthe unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good\r\nfor them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was a young mother and she\r\ndid not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an\r\nhour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to\r\nhear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the sound of\r\nmuffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She\r\nstood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy? It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff\r\ndanger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog,\r\nand with one warning cry he roused the others. He stood motionless, one hand to his ear. \u201cPirates!\u201d he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile\r\nwas playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smile\r\nwas on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready\r\nto obey. The order came sharp and incisive. \u201cDive!\u201d There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.\r\nMarooners\u2019 Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself\r\nmarooned. The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smee\r\nand Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. Her hands and\r\nankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. She was to be left on\r\nthe rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire\r\nor torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no\r\npath through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she\r\nwas the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief\u2019s daughter, it is\r\nenough. They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth. No\r\nwatch was kept on the ship, it being Hook\u2019s boast that the wind of his\r\nname guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to guard it\r\nalso. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night. In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock\r\ntill they crashed into it. \u201cLuff, you lubber,\u201d cried an Irish voice that was Smee\u2019s;\r\n\u201chere\u2019s the rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the\r\nredskin on to it and leave her here to drown.\u201d It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock;\r\nshe was too proud to offer a vain resistance. Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down,\r\nPeter\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy\r\nshe had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all. He\r\nwas less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angered\r\nhim, and he meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until the\r\npirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way. There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice of\r\nHook. \u201cAhoy there, you lubbers!\u201d he called. It was a marvellous\r\nimitation. \u201cThe captain!\u201d said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise. \u201cHe must be swimming out to us,\u201d Starkey said, when they had looked\r\nfor him in vain. \u201cWe are putting the redskin on the rock,\u201d Smee called out. \u201cSet her free,\u201d came the astonishing answer. \u201cFree!\u201d \u201cYes, cut her bonds and let her go.\u201d \u201cBut, captain\u2014\u201d \u201cAt once, d\u2019ye hear,\u201d cried Peter, \u201cor I\u2019ll\r\nplunge my hook in you.\u201d \u201cThis is queer!\u201d Smee gasped. \u201cBetter do what the captain orders,\u201d said Starkey nervously. \u201cAy, ay,\u201d Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily\u2019s cords. At once\r\nlike an eel she slid between Starkey\u2019s legs into the water. Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter\u2019s cleverness; but she knew\r\nthat he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so\r\nat once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was stayed even in the\r\nact, for \u201cBoat ahoy!\u201d rang over the lagoon in Hook\u2019s voice,\r\nand this time it was not Peter who had spoken. Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle of\r\nsurprise instead. \u201cBoat ahoy!\u201d again came the voice. Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water. He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he had\r\nsoon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook grip the\r\nboat\u2019s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from the\r\nwater, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but Peter would not\r\nbudge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. \u201cAm I\r\nnot a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!\u201d he whispered to her, and though she\r\nthought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one\r\nheard him except herself. He signed to her to listen. The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to\r\nthem, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound\r\nmelancholy. \u201cCaptain, is all well?\u201d they asked timidly, but he answered with a\r\nhollow moan. \u201cHe sighs,\u201d said Smee. \u201cHe sighs again,\u201d said Starkey. \u201cAnd yet a third time he sighs,\u201d said Smee. Then at last he spoke passionately. \u201cThe game\u2019s up,\u201d he cried, \u201cthose boys have found a\r\nmother.\u201d Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride. \u201cO evil day!\u201d cried Starkey. \u201cWhat\u2019s a mother?\u201d asked the ignorant Smee. Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know!\u201d\r\nand always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would\r\nbe her one. Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d \u201cI heard nothing,\u201d said Starkey, raising the lantern over the\r\nwaters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I\r\nhave told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it. \u201cSee,\u201d said Hook in answer to Smee\u2019s question, \u201cthat is\r\na mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would\r\nthe mother desert her eggs? No.\u201d There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent days\r\nwhen\u2014but he brushed away this weakness with his hook. Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but the\r\nmore suspicious Starkey said, \u201cIf she is a mother, perhaps she is hanging\r\nabout here to help Peter.\u201d Hook winced. \u201cAy,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is the fear that haunts\r\nme.\u201d He was roused from this dejection by Smee\u2019s eager voice. \u201cCaptain,\u201d said Smee, \u201ccould we not kidnap these boys\u2019\r\nmother and make her our mother?\u201d \u201cIt is a princely scheme,\u201d cried Hook, and at once it took\r\npractical shape in his great brain. \u201cWe will seize the children and carry\r\nthem to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our\r\nmother.\u201d Again Wendy forgot herself. \u201cNever!\u201d she cried, and bobbed. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind.\r\n\u201cDo you agree, my bullies?\u201d asked Hook. \u201cThere is my hand on it,\u201d they both said. \u201cAnd there is my hook. Swear.\u201d They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook\r\nremembered Tiger Lily. \u201cWhere is the redskin?\u201d he demanded abruptly. He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the\r\nmoments. \u201cThat is all right, captain,\u201d Smee answered complacently; \u201cwe\r\nlet her go.\u201d \u201cLet her go!\u201d cried Hook. \u201c\u2019Twas your own orders,\u201d the bo\u2019sun faltered. \u201cYou called over the water to us to let her go,\u201d said Starkey. \u201cBrimstone and gall,\u201d thundered Hook, \u201cwhat cozening is going\r\non here!\u201d His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they\r\nbelieved their words, and he was startled. \u201cLads,\u201d he said, shaking\r\na little, \u201cI gave no such order.\u201d \u201cIt is passing queer,\u201d Smee said, and they all fidgeted\r\nuncomfortably. Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it. \u201cSpirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,\u201d he cried,\r\n\u201cdost hear me?\u201d Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He\r\nimmediately answered in Hook\u2019s voice: \u201cOdds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.\u201d In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee and\r\nStarkey clung to each other in terror. \u201cWho are you, stranger? Speak!\u201d Hook demanded. \u201cI am James Hook,\u201d replied the voice, \u201ccaptain of the Jolly Roger .\u201d \u201cYou are not; you are not,\u201d Hook cried hoarsely. \u201cBrimstone and gall,\u201d the voice retorted, \u201csay that again,\r\nand I\u2019ll cast anchor in you.\u201d Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. \u201cIf you are Hook,\u201d he said\r\nalmost humbly, \u201ccome tell me, who am I?\u201d \u201cA codfish,\u201d replied the voice, \u201conly a codfish.\u201d \u201cA codfish!\u201d Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till\r\nthen, that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him. \u201cHave we been captained all this time by a codfish!\u201d they muttered.\r\n\u201cIt is lowering to our pride.\u201d They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had become, he\r\nscarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in\r\nhim that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego slipping from him.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t desert me, bully,\u201d he whispered hoarsely to it. In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the great\r\npirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried the guessing\r\ngame. \u201cHook,\u201d he called, \u201chave you another voice?\u201d Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own voice,\r\n\u201cI have.\u201d \u201cAnd another name?\u201d \u201cAy, ay.\u201d \u201cVegetable?\u201d asked Hook. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cMineral?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAnimal?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cMan?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d This answer rang out scornfully. \u201cBoy?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOrdinary boy?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cWonderful boy?\u201d To Wendy\u2019s pain the answer that rang out this time was \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAre you in England?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAre you here?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Hook was completely puzzled. \u201cYou ask him some questions,\u201d he said\r\nto the others, wiping his damp brow. Smee reflected. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a thing,\u201d he said\r\nregretfully. \u201cCan\u2019t guess, can\u2019t guess!\u201d crowed Peter. \u201cDo you\r\ngive it up?\u201d Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the miscreants\r\nsaw their chance. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d they answered eagerly. \u201cWell, then,\u201d he cried, \u201cI am Peter Pan.\u201d Pan! In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his faithful\r\nhenchmen. \u201cNow we have him,\u201d Hook shouted. \u201cInto the water, Smee.\r\nStarkey, mind the boat. Take him dead or alive!\u201d He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter. \u201cAre you ready, boys?\u201d \u201cAy, ay,\u201d from various parts of the lagoon. \u201cThen lam into the pirates.\u201d The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who gallantly\r\nclimbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce struggle, in which the\r\ncutlass was torn from the pirate\u2019s grasp. He wriggled overboard and John\r\nleapt after him. The dinghy drifted away. Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel\r\nfollowed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at their own side.\r\nThe corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he was himself pinked\r\nin turn by Curly. Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the\r\ntwins hard. Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game. The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing from\r\nthe pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, from\r\nwhich they fled like affrighted fishes. But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter that\r\ncircle. Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock to\r\nbreathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. The rock\r\nwas slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knew\r\nthat the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip met the other\u2019s arm:\r\nin surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they\r\nmet. Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to they\r\nhad a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After\r\nall, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had no\r\nsinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth\r\nwith joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook\u2019s belt and was\r\nabout to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his\r\nfoe. It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help\r\nhim up. It was then that Hook bit him. Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made him quite\r\nhelpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus the\r\nfirst time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he has a right to when he\r\ncomes to you to be yours is fairness. After you have been unfair to him he will\r\nlove you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever\r\ngets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he\r\nalways forgot it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all\r\nthe rest. So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just stare,\r\nhelpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him. A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildly\r\nfor the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the\r\ncrocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys would\r\nhave swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both\r\nPeter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name.\r\nThey found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting \u201cPeter, Wendy\u201d\r\nas they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.\r\n\u201cThey must be swimming back or flying,\u201d the boys concluded. They\r\nwere not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled,\r\nboylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother\r\nWendy\u2019s fault! When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a\r\nfeeble cry. \u201cHelp, help!\u201d Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and lay\r\non the boy\u2019s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock and\r\nthen lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was\r\nrising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more. As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pulling\r\nher softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start,\r\nand was just in time to draw her back. But he had to tell her the truth. \u201cWe are on the rock, Wendy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is growing\r\nsmaller. Soon the water will be over it.\u201d She did not understand even now. \u201cWe must go,\u201d she said, almost brightly. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered faintly. \u201cShall we swim or fly, Peter?\u201d He had to tell her. \u201cDo you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without\r\nmy help?\u201d She had to admit that she was too tired. He moaned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, anxious about him at once. \u201cI can\u2019t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor\r\nswim.\u201d \u201cDo you mean we shall both be drowned?\u201d \u201cLook how the water is rising.\u201d They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought they\r\nwould soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against Peter as\r\nlight as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, \u201cCan I be of any\r\nuse?\u201d It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It had torn\r\nitself out of his hand and floated away. \u201cMichael\u2019s kite,\u201d Peter said without interest, but next\r\nmoment he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him. \u201cIt lifted Michael off the ground,\u201d he cried; \u201cwhy should it\r\nnot carry you?\u201d \u201cBoth of us!\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.\u201d \u201cLet us draw lots,\u201d Wendy said bravely. \u201cAnd you a lady; never.\u201d Already he had tied the tail round her.\r\nShe clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a \u201cGood-bye,\r\nWendy,\u201d he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne\r\nout of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon. The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of light\r\ntiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once\r\nthe most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to\r\nthe moon. Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ran\r\nthrough him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder\r\nfollows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one.\r\nNext moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his\r\nface and a drum beating within him. It was saying, \u201cTo die will be an\r\nawfully big adventure.\u201d",
  "Chapter IX": "Chapter IX. THE NEVER BIRD The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring\r\none by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far away to hear\r\ntheir doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a\r\ntiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the\r\nmainland), and he heard the bells. Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the\r\ntime until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon.\r\nHe thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and\r\nwondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore. Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the\r\nlagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes\r\nwinning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could\r\nnot help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper. It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate\r\nefforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a way she had\r\nlearned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent to\r\nguide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was very\r\nexhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there were\r\neggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he\r\nhad also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling\r\nand the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth. She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she\r\nwas doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other\u2019s\r\nlanguage. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish\r\nfor the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter\r\nreplied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell\r\nyou only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand each\r\nother, but they forgot their manners. \u201cI\u2014want\u2014you\u2014to\u2014get\u2014into\u2014the\u2014nest,\u201d\r\nthe bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible,\r\n\u201cand\u2014then\u2014you\u2014can\u2014drift\u2014ashore,\r\nbut\u2014I\u2014am\u2014too\u2014tired\u2014to\u2014bring\u2014it\u2014any\u2014nearer\u2014so\u2014you\u2014must\u2014try\r\nto\u2014swim\u2014to\u2014it.\u201d \u201cWhat are you quacking about?\u201d Peter answered. \u201cWhy\r\ndon\u2019t you let the nest drift as usual?\u201d \u201cI\u2014want\u2014you\u2014\u201d the bird said, and repeated it all\r\nover. Then Peter tried slow and distinct. \u201cWhat\u2014are\u2014you\u2014quacking\u2014about?\u201d and so on. The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers. \u201cYou dunderheaded little jay!\u201d she screamed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\r\nyou do as I tell you?\u201d Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly: \u201cSo are you!\u201d Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark: \u201cShut up!\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one last\r\nmighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up she flew;\r\ndeserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear. Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the\r\nbird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks, however, that\r\nshe hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it\r\nwas to see what he did with her eggs. There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected. The\r\nbird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; but\r\nshe could not help peeping between the feathers. I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven\r\ninto it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure. The\r\nchildren had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood\r\nused to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the\r\ngulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy\r\ntrick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on it\r\nStarkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.\r\nPeter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated\r\nbeautifully. The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration of\r\nhim; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then he got into the nest,\r\nreared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail. At the same\r\nmoment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her\r\neggs. She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both\r\ncheering. Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the bird\r\nwould easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned\r\nthe nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came to\r\nthe shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting\r\non his hat. As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here that\r\nall Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the\r\nyoungsters take an airing. Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost\r\nas soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every\r\nboy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that\r\nthey were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did\r\nvarious dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding\r\nbandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and\r\nsound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, \u201cTo bed,\r\nto bed,\u201d in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was\r\nawfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played till\r\nbed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.",
  "Chapter X": "Chapter X. THE HAPPY HOME One important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the redskins\r\ntheir friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there\r\nwas nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above,\r\nkeeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the\r\npirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung\r\nabout, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits\r\nto eat. They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before him;\r\nand he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for him. \u201cThe great white father,\u201d he would say to them in a very lordly\r\nmanner, as they grovelled at his feet, \u201cis glad to see the Piccaninny\r\nwarriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates.\u201d \u201cMe Tiger Lily,\u201d that lovely creature would reply. \u201cPeter Pan\r\nsave me, me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.\u201d She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, and\r\nhe would answer condescendingly, \u201cIt is good. Peter Pan has\r\nspoken.\u201d Always when he said, \u201cPeter Pan has spoken,\u201d it meant that they\r\nmust now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by\r\nno means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just\r\nordinary braves. They said \u201cHow-do?\u201d to them, and things like that;\r\nand what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right. Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal a\r\nhousewife to listen to any complaints against father. \u201cFather knows\r\nbest,\u201d she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her private\r\nopinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw. We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of\r\nNights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietly\r\ngathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their\r\nblankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having\r\ntheir evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way\r\nyou got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near\r\nhim till the clock struck. The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board,\r\nguzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and\r\nrecriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To be sure,\r\nshe did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, and\r\nthen excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There\r\nwas a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the\r\nmatter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying,\r\n\u201cI complain of so-and-so;\u201d but what usually happened was that they\r\nforgot to do this or did it too much. \u201cSilence,\u201d cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told\r\nthem that they were not all to speak at once. \u201cIs your mug empty,\r\nSlightly darling?\u201d \u201cNot quite empty, mummy,\u201d Slightly said, after looking into an\r\nimaginary mug. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even begun to drink his milk,\u201d Nibs interposed. This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance. \u201cI complain of Nibs,\u201d he cried promptly. John, however, had held up his hand first. \u201cWell, John?\u201d \u201cMay I sit in Peter\u2019s chair, as he is not here?\u201d \u201cSit in father\u2019s chair, John!\u201d Wendy was scandalised.\r\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d \u201cHe is not really our father,\u201d John answered. \u201cHe\r\ndidn\u2019t even know how a father does till I showed him.\u201d This was grumbling. \u201cWe complain of John,\u201d cried the twins. Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he was\r\nthe only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose,\u201d Tootles said diffidently, \u201cthat I\r\ncould be father.\u201d \u201cNo, Tootles.\u201d Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of going on. \u201cAs I can\u2019t be father,\u201d he said heavily, \u201cI don\u2019t\r\nsuppose, Michael, you would let me be baby?\u201d \u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Michael rapped out. He was already in his\r\nbasket. \u201cAs I can\u2019t be baby,\u201d Tootles said, getting heavier and\r\nheavier and heavier, \u201cdo you think I could be a twin?\u201d \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d replied the twins; \u201cit\u2019s awfully\r\ndifficult to be a twin.\u201d \u201cAs I can\u2019t be anything important,\u201d said Tootles,\r\n\u201cwould any of you like to see me do a trick?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d they all replied. Then at last he stopped. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really any hope,\u201d he said. The hateful telling broke out again. \u201cSlightly is coughing on the table.\u201d \u201cThe twins began with cheese-cakes.\u201d \u201cCurly is taking both butter and honey.\u201d \u201cNibs is speaking with his mouth full.\u201d \u201cI complain of the twins.\u201d \u201cI complain of Curly.\u201d \u201cI complain of Nibs.\u201d \u201cOh dear, oh dear,\u201d cried Wendy, \u201cI\u2019m sure I sometimes\r\nthink that spinsters are to be envied.\u201d She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy load of\r\nstockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual. \u201cWendy,\u201d remonstrated Michael, \u201cI\u2019m too big for a\r\ncradle.\u201d \u201cI must have somebody in a cradle,\u201d she said almost tartly,\r\n\u201cand you are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have\r\nabout a house.\u201d While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancing\r\nlimbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very familiar scene, this,\r\nin the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time. There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize\r\nit. \u201cChildren, I hear your father\u2019s step. He likes you to meet him at\r\nthe door.\u201d Above, the redskins crouched before Peter. \u201cWatch well, braves. I have spoken.\u201d And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his tree. As so\r\noften before, but never again. He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy. \u201cPeter, you just spoil them, you know,\u201d Wendy simpered. \u201cAh, old lady,\u201d said Peter, hanging up his gun. \u201cIt was me told him mothers are called old lady,\u201d Michael whispered\r\nto Curly. \u201cI complain of Michael,\u201d said Curly instantly. The first twin came to Peter. \u201cFather, we want to dance.\u201d \u201cDance away, my little man,\u201d said Peter, who was in high good\r\nhumour. \u201cBut we want you to dance.\u201d Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be\r\nscandalised. \u201cMe! My old bones would rattle!\u201d \u201cAnd mummy too.\u201d \u201cWhat,\u201d cried Wendy, \u201cthe mother of such an armful,\r\ndance!\u201d \u201cBut on a Saturday night,\u201d Slightly insinuated. It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had long\r\nlost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special they\r\nsaid this was Saturday night, and then they did it. \u201cOf course it is Saturday night, Peter,\u201d Wendy said, relenting. \u201cPeople of our figure, Wendy!\u201d \u201cBut it is only among our own progeny.\u201d \u201cTrue, true.\u201d So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first. \u201cAh, old lady,\u201d Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the\r\nfire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, \u201cthere is nothing\r\nmore pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day\u2019s toil is over\r\nthan to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.\u201d \u201cIt is sweet, Peter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Wendy said, frightfully\r\ngratified. \u201cPeter, I think Curly has your nose.\u201d \u201cMichael takes after you.\u201d She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cDear Peter,\u201d she said, \u201cwith such a large family, of course,\r\nI have now passed my best, but you don\u2019t want to change me, do\r\nyou?\u201d \u201cNo, Wendy.\u201d Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,\r\nblinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep. \u201cPeter, what is it?\u201d \u201cI was just thinking,\u201d he said, a little scared. \u201cIt is only\r\nmake-believe, isn\u2019t it, that I am their father?\u201d \u201cOh yes,\u201d Wendy said primly. \u201cYou see,\u201d he continued apologetically, \u201cit would make me\r\nseem so old to be their real father.\u201d \u201cBut they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.\u201d \u201cBut not really, Wendy?\u201d he asked anxiously. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t wish it,\u201d she replied; and she distinctly\r\nheard his sigh of relief. \u201cPeter,\u201d she asked, trying to speak\r\nfirmly, \u201cwhat are your exact feelings to me?\u201d \u201cThose of a devoted son, Wendy.\u201d \u201cI thought so,\u201d she said, and went and sat by herself at the\r\nextreme end of the room. \u201cYou are so queer,\u201d he said, frankly puzzled, \u201cand Tiger Lily\r\nis just the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is\r\nnot my mother.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, it is not,\u201d Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now\r\nwe know why she was prejudiced against the redskins. \u201cThen what is it?\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t for a lady to tell.\u201d \u201cOh, very well,\u201d Peter said, a little nettled. \u201cPerhaps\r\nTinker Bell will tell me.\u201d \u201cOh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,\u201d Wendy retorted scornfully.\r\n\u201cShe is an abandoned little creature.\u201d Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something\r\nimpudent. \u201cShe says she glories in being abandoned,\u201d Peter interpreted. He had a sudden idea. \u201cPerhaps Tink wants to be my mother?\u201d \u201cYou silly ass!\u201d cried Tinker Bell in a passion. She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation. \u201cI almost agree with her,\u201d Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But\r\nshe had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the\r\nnight was out. If she had known she would not have snapped. None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance gave them\r\none more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let us\r\nrejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They sang and danced in their\r\nnight-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to\r\nbe frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would\r\nclose in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously\r\ngay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it!\r\nIt was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the\r\npillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never\r\nmeet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy\u2019s\r\ngood-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the\r\nbeginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but\r\nhimself, and he said gloomily: \u201cYes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the\r\nend.\u201d And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy\u2019s story, the story they\r\nloved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story he\r\nleft the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if he had done\r\neither of those things this time they might all still be on the island. But\r\nto-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened.",
  "Chapter XI": "Chapter XI. WENDY\u2019S STORY \u201cListen, then,\u201d said Wendy, settling down to her story, with\r\nMichael at her feet and seven boys in the bed. \u201cThere was once a\r\ngentleman\u2014\u201d \u201cI had rather he had been a lady,\u201d Curly said. \u201cI wish he had been a white rat,\u201d said Nibs. \u201cQuiet,\u201d their mother admonished them. \u201cThere was a lady\r\nalso, and\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, mummy,\u201d cried the first twin, \u201cyou mean that there is a\r\nlady also, don\u2019t you? She is not dead, is she?\u201d \u201cOh, no.\u201d \u201cI am awfully glad she isn\u2019t dead,\u201d said Tootles. \u201cAre\r\nyou glad, John?\u201d \u201cOf course I am.\u201d \u201cAre you glad, Nibs?\u201d \u201cRather.\u201d \u201cAre you glad, Twins?\u201d \u201cWe are glad.\u201d \u201cOh dear,\u201d sighed Wendy. \u201cLittle less noise there,\u201d Peter called out, determined that she\r\nshould have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion. \u201cThe gentleman\u2019s name,\u201d Wendy continued, \u201cwas Mr.\r\nDarling, and her name was Mrs. Darling.\u201d \u201cI knew them,\u201d John said, to annoy the others. \u201cI think I knew them,\u201d said Michael rather doubtfully. \u201cThey were married, you know,\u201d explained Wendy, \u201cand what do\r\nyou think they had?\u201d \u201cWhite rats,\u201d cried Nibs, inspired. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s awfully puzzling,\u201d said Tootles, who knew the story by\r\nheart. \u201cQuiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.\u201d \u201cWhat is descendants?\u201d \u201cWell, you are one, Twin.\u201d \u201cDid you hear that, John? I am a descendant.\u201d \u201cDescendants are only children,\u201d said John. \u201cOh dear, oh dear,\u201d sighed Wendy. \u201cNow these three children\r\nhad a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and\r\nchained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an awfully good story,\u201d said Nibs. \u201cThey flew away,\u201d Wendy continued, \u201cto the Neverland, where\r\nthe lost children are.\u201d \u201cI just thought they did,\u201d Curly broke in excitedly. \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t know how it is, but I just thought they did!\u201d \u201cO Wendy,\u201d cried Tootles, \u201cwas one of the lost children\r\ncalled Tootles?\u201d \u201cYes, he was.\u201d \u201cI am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.\u201d \u201cHush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents\r\nwith all their children flown away.\u201d \u201cOo!\u201d they all moaned, though they were not really considering the\r\nfeelings of the unhappy parents one jot. \u201cThink of the empty beds!\u201d \u201cOo!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s awfully sad,\u201d the first twin said cheerfully. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it can have a happy ending,\u201d said the second\r\ntwin. \u201cDo you, Nibs?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m frightfully anxious.\u201d \u201cIf you knew how great is a mother\u2019s love,\u201d Wendy told them\r\ntriumphantly, \u201cyou would have no fear.\u201d She had now come to the\r\npart that Peter hated. \u201cI do like a mother\u2019s love,\u201d said Tootles, hitting Nibs with\r\na pillow. \u201cDo you like a mother\u2019s love, Nibs?\u201d \u201cI do just,\u201d said Nibs, hitting back. \u201cYou see,\u201d Wendy said complacently, \u201cour heroine knew that\r\nthe mother would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by;\r\nso they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.\u201d \u201cDid they ever go back?\u201d \u201cLet us now,\u201d said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,\r\n\u201ctake a peep into the future;\u201d and they all gave themselves the\r\ntwist that makes peeps into the future easier. \u201cYears have rolled by, and\r\nwho is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?\u201d \u201cO Wendy, who is she?\u201d cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he\r\ndidn\u2019t know. \u201cCan it be\u2014yes\u2014no\u2014it is\u2014the fair Wendy!\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d \u201cAnd who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to\r\nman\u2019s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d \u201c\u2018See, dear brothers,\u2019 says Wendy pointing upwards,\r\n\u2018there is the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our\r\nsublime faith in a mother\u2019s love.\u2019 So up they flew to their mummy\r\nand daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a\r\nveil.\u201d That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator\r\nherself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip like the most\r\nheartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive;\r\nand we have an entirely selfish time, and then when we have need of special\r\nattention we nobly return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded instead\r\nof smacked. So great indeed was their faith in a mother\u2019s love that they felt they\r\ncould afford to be callous for a bit longer. But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he uttered a\r\nhollow groan. \u201cWhat is it, Peter?\u201d she cried, running to him, thinking he was\r\nill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. \u201cWhere is it,\r\nPeter?\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t that kind of pain,\u201d Peter replied darkly. \u201cThen what kind is it?\u201d \u201cWendy, you are wrong about mothers.\u201d They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; and\r\nwith a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed. \u201cLong ago,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought like you that my mother would\r\nalways keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and\r\nmoons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten\r\nall about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.\u201d I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scared\r\nthem. \u201cAre you sure mothers are like that?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d So this was the truth about mothers. The toads! Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child when he\r\nshould give in. \u201cWendy, let us go home,\u201d cried John and Michael\r\ntogether. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, clutching them. \u201cNot to-night?\u201d asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what\r\nthey called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and\r\nthat it is only the mothers who think you can\u2019t. \u201cAt once,\u201d Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had\r\ncome to her: \u201cPerhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.\u201d This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter\u2019s feelings, and she\r\nsaid to him rather sharply, \u201cPeter, will you make the necessary\r\narrangements?\u201d \u201cIf you wish it,\u201d he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to\r\npass the nuts. Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind the\r\nparting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he. But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against\r\ngrown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he got\r\ninside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of\r\nabout five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in the Neverland\r\nthat, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them off\r\nvindictively as fast as possible. Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to the\r\nhome, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence. Panic-stricken\r\nat the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced upon her\r\nthreateningly. \u201cIt will be worse than before she came,\u201d they cried. \u201cWe shan\u2019t let her go.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s keep her prisoner.\u201d \u201cAy, chain her up.\u201d In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn. \u201cTootles,\u201d she cried, \u201cI appeal to you.\u201d Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one. Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped his\r\nsilliness and spoke with dignity. \u201cI am just Tootles,\u201d he said, \u201cand nobody minds me. But the\r\nfirst who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him\r\nseverely.\u201d He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The others\r\nheld back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once that they would\r\nget no support from him. He would keep no girl in the Neverland against her\r\nwill. \u201cWendy,\u201d he said, striding up and down, \u201cI have asked the\r\nredskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.\u201d \u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to\r\nbe obeyed, \u201cTinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her,\r\nNibs.\u201d Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really been\r\nsitting up in bed listening for some time. \u201cWho are you? How dare you? Go away,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou are to get up, Tink,\u201d Nibs called, \u201cand take Wendy on a\r\njourney.\u201d Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she was\r\njolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still more\r\noffensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again. \u201cShe says she won\u2019t!\u201d Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such\r\ninsubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady\u2019s\r\nchamber. \u201cTink,\u201d he rapped out, \u201cif you don\u2019t get up and dress\r\nat once I will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your neglig\u00c3\u00a9e .\u201d This made her leap to the floor. \u201cWho said I wasn\u2019t getting\r\nup?\u201d she cried. In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now equipped with\r\nJohn and Michael for the journey. By this time they were dejected, not merely\r\nbecause they were about to lose her, but also because they felt that she was\r\ngoing off to something nice to which they had not been invited. Novelty was\r\nbeckoning to them as usual. Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted. \u201cDear ones,\u201d she said, \u201cif you will all come with me I feel\r\nalmost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you.\u201d The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was thinking\r\nexclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy. \u201cBut won\u2019t they think us rather a handful?\u201d Nibs asked in the\r\nmiddle of his jump. \u201cOh no,\u201d said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, \u201cit will only\r\nmean having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the\r\nscreens on first Thursdays.\u201d \u201cPeter, can we go?\u201d they all cried imploringly. They took it for\r\ngranted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared.\r\nThus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest\r\nones. \u201cAll right,\u201d Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately\r\nthey rushed to get their things. \u201cAnd now, Peter,\u201d Wendy said, thinking she had put everything\r\nright, \u201cI am going to give you your medicine before you go.\u201d She\r\nloved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it\r\nwas only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and\r\ncounted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion,\r\nhowever, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as she had prepared it,\r\nshe saw a look on his face that made her heart sink. \u201cGet your things, Peter,\u201d she cried, shaking. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered, pretending indifference, \u201cI am not going\r\nwith you, Wendy.\u201d \u201cYes, Peter.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and down the\r\nroom, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run about after him,\r\nthough it was rather undignified. \u201cTo find your mother,\u201d she coaxed. Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He could do\r\nvery well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered only their bad\r\npoints. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he told Wendy decisively; \u201cperhaps she would say I\r\nwas old, and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.\u201d \u201cBut, Peter\u2014\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d And so the others had to be told. \u201cPeter isn\u2019t coming.\u201d Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their backs, and\r\non each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter was not going he\r\nhad probably changed his mind about letting them go. But he was far too proud for that. \u201cIf you find your mothers,\u201d he\r\nsaid darkly, \u201cI hope you will like them.\u201d The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of them\r\nbegan to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were they not\r\nnoodles to want to go? \u201cNow then,\u201d cried Peter, \u201cno fuss, no blubbering; good-bye,\r\nWendy;\u201d and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really\r\ngo now, for he had something important to do. She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would prefer a\r\nthimble. \u201cYou will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?\u201d she said,\r\nlingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd you will take your medicine?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter, however,\r\nwas not the kind that breaks down before other people. \u201cAre you ready,\r\nTinker Bell?\u201d he called out. \u201cAy, ay.\u201d \u201cThen lead the way.\u201d Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at this\r\nmoment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above,\r\nwhere all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of\r\nsteel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy\r\nfell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter. All arms were\r\nextended to him, as if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseeching\r\nhim mutely not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he\r\nthought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.",
  "Chapter XII": "Chapter XII. THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the\r\nunscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly\r\nis beyond the wit of the white man. By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who\r\nattacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn, at\r\nwhich time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb. The\r\nwhite men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder\r\nundulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to\r\nbe too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones\r\nclutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping\r\ntranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage\r\nscouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The\r\nbrushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.\r\nNot a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation\r\nof the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and some\r\nof them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the\r\nchill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface\r\nwho has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those\r\nghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the\r\nnight is marching. That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in\r\ndisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance. The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and their\r\nwhole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his. They left\r\nnothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe. With\r\nthat alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of\r\ncivilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from the\r\nmoment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space of\r\ntime the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where Hook\r\nhad landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by\r\nbraves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one\r\nhillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must\r\nestablish himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus\r\nmapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded\r\ntheir blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the\r\npearl of manhood squatted above the children\u2019s home, awaiting the cold\r\nmoment when they should deal pale death. Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they were\r\nto put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the\r\ntreacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts\r\nas escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have paused at the rising\r\nground, though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it: no\r\nthought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited\r\nhis subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on\r\nhe pounded with no policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do,\r\nmasters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot\r\nhelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gave\r\npathetic utterance to the coyote cry. Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and they\r\nsuddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell from their\r\neyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would they\r\ntorture at the stake. For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it;\r\nbut as their father\u2019s sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they had\r\ntime to gather in a phalanx that would have been hard to break had they risen\r\nquickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It\r\nis written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of\r\nthe white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been\r\nto them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if the\r\nfoe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they\r\nseized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too\r\nlate. It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus\r\nperished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all unavenged did they\r\ndie, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more,\r\nand among others who bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the\r\nAlsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who\r\nultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of\r\nthe tribe. To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the\r\nhistorian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he\r\nand his men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him it is only\r\nfair to take this into account. What he should perhaps have done was to\r\nacquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the other\r\nhand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his strategy\r\nof no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot\r\nat least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold\r\na scheme, and the fell genius with which it was carried out. What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain would\r\nhis dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they\r\ngathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and squinted through their\r\nferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, but\r\nhis face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof\r\nfrom his followers in spirit as in substance. The night\u2019s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had\r\ncome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he should get\r\nat the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chiefly\r\nPan. Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man\u2019s hatred\r\nof him. True he had flung Hook\u2019s arm to the crocodile, but even this and\r\nthe increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the\r\ncrocodile\u2019s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness so\r\nrelentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about Peter\r\nwhich goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was not\r\nhis engaging appearance, it was not\u2014. There is no beating about the bush,\r\nfor we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter\u2019s\r\ncockiness. This had got on Hook\u2019s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at night\r\nit disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured man felt that\r\nhe was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come. The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs down? He\r\nran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. They wriggled\r\nuncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles. In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang of the\r\nweapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with\r\noutstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, and\r\ntheir arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as\r\nsuddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in\r\nthe passing it has determined their fate. Which side had won? The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question\r\nput by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter\u2019s answer. \u201cIf the redskins have won,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will beat the\r\ntom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.\u201d Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.\r\n\u201cYou will never hear the tom-tom again,\u201d he muttered, but inaudibly\r\nof course, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook signed\r\nhim to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the\r\ndreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admired\r\nHook so much. Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully. \u201cThe tom-tom,\u201d the miscreants heard Peter cry; \u201can Indian\r\nvictory!\u201d The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts\r\nabove, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. This\r\npuzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base\r\ndelight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked at each\r\nother and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: one\r\nman to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards\r\napart.",
  "Chapter XIII": "Chapter XIII. DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES? The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to emerge\r\nfrom his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flung\r\nhim to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flung\r\nhim to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the\r\nfeet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in this\r\nruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales of\r\ngoods flung from hand to hand. A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With ironical\r\npoliteness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, escorted her\r\nto the spot where the others were being gagged. He did it with such an air, he\r\nwas so frightfully distingu\u00c3\u00a9 , that she was too fascinated to cry out.\r\nShe was only a little girl. Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her, and we\r\ntell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtily\r\nunhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have been\r\nhurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have\r\nbeen present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying he\r\nwould not have discovered Slightly\u2019s secret, and without the secret he\r\ncould not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter\u2019s life. They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees close\r\nto their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope\r\ninto nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly\u2019s turn came, when he\r\nwas found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in\r\ngoing round and leave no tags with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him\r\nin their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick\r\nthe string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their\r\nviolence. His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely\r\nsweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one\r\npart he bulged out in another, Hook\u2019s master mind had gone far beneath\r\nSlightly\u2019s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his\r\nexultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills, knew\r\nthat Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out\r\ncould use a tree wherein an average man need stick. Poor Slightly, most\r\nwretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly\r\nregretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was\r\nhot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead of\r\nreducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his\r\ntree to make it fit him. Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at his\r\nmercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean\r\ncaverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives were\r\nto be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone. How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down\r\nhill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass. Again Hook\u2019s\r\ngenius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the little house must be used\r\nas a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it\r\non their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate\r\nchorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I don\u2019t know\r\nwhether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound;\r\nbut as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of\r\nsmoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook. Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pity\r\nfor him that may have remained in the pirate\u2019s infuriated breast. The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was\r\nto tiptoe to Slightly\u2019s tree, and make sure that it provided him with a\r\npassage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward,\r\nso that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his\r\nhair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle.\r\nIntently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent\r\nbelow as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty\r\ntenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot\r\nof Slightly\u2019s tree, with his dagger in his hand? There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip softly\r\nto the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he\r\nstepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop\r\nthere and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, he\r\nlet himself go into the unknown. He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting\r\nat his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became accustomed to the\r\ndim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only\r\none on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the\r\ngreat bed. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep. Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little\r\ntime after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a\r\nforlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care. Then he decided not\r\nto take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bed\r\noutside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them\r\ninside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of\r\nthe night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be\r\nif he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the\r\nmiddle of it. Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than the\r\ndreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from these dreams,\r\nthough he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle of\r\nhis existence. At such times it had been Wendy\u2019s custom to take him out\r\nof bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own\r\ninvention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke\r\nup, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him.\r\nBut on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm\r\ndropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part\r\nof his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little\r\npearls. Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree\r\nlooking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturb\r\nhis sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have been\r\ntold) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord);\r\nand, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him\r\nprofoundly. Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up\r\nthe tree, but for one thing. What stayed him was Peter\u2019s impertinent appearance as he slept. The open\r\nmouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of\r\ncockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to\r\neyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They steeled Hook\u2019s heart. If\r\nhis rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have\r\ndisregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper. Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness\r\nhimself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, the\r\ndoor of Slightly\u2019s tree. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he\r\nhad been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it\r\nwas low down, beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that the\r\nirritating quality in Peter\u2019s face and figure visibly increased, and he\r\nrattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him\r\nafter all? But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter\u2019s\r\nmedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was\r\nstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power. Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadful\r\ndrug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his\r\npossession. These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to\r\nscience, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence. Five drops of this he now added to Peter\u2019s cup. His hand shook, but it\r\nwas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing at the\r\nsleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling. Then\r\none long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way\r\nwith difficulty up the tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit\r\nof evil breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he\r\nwound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his\r\nperson from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering\r\nstrangely to himself, stole away through the trees. Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement in\r\ndarkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o\u2019clock\r\nby the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not\r\nwhat. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree. Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for his\r\ndagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke. \u201cWho is that?\u201d For long there was no answer: then again the knock. \u201cWho are you?\u201d No answer. He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached the\r\ndoor. Unlike Slightly\u2019s door, it filled the aperture, so that he could\r\nnot see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him. \u201cI won\u2019t open unless you speak,\u201d Peter cried. Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice. \u201cLet me in, Peter.\u201d It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her face\r\nflushed and her dress stained with mud. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cOh, you could never guess!\u201d she cried, and offered him three\r\nguesses. \u201cOut with it!\u201d he shouted, and in one ungrammatical\r\nsentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she\r\ntold of the capture of Wendy and the boys. Peter\u2019s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the\r\npirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so! \u201cI\u2019ll rescue her!\u201d he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he\r\nleapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his\r\nmedicine. His hand closed on the fatal draught. \u201cNo!\u201d shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his\r\ndeed as he sped through the forest. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cIt is poisoned.\u201d \u201cPoisoned? Who could have poisoned it?\u201d \u201cHook.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?\u201d Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the dark\r\nsecret of Slightly\u2019s tree. Nevertheless Hook\u2019s words had left no\r\nroom for doubt. The cup was poisoned. \u201cBesides,\u201d said Peter, quite believing himself, \u201cI never fell\r\nasleep.\u201d He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of her\r\nlightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained it\r\nto the dregs. \u201cWhy, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?\u201d But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air. \u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d cried Peter, suddenly afraid. \u201cIt was poisoned, Peter,\u201d she told him softly; \u201cand now I am\r\ngoing to be dead.\u201d \u201cO Tink, did you drink it to save me?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut why, Tink?\u201d Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his\r\nshoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear \u201cYou\r\nsilly ass,\u201d and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed. His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her\r\nin distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and he knew that if it\r\nwent out she would be no more. She liked his tears so much that she put out her\r\nbeautiful finger and let them run over it. Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. Then he\r\nmade it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well again if\r\nchildren believed in fairies. Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time;\r\nbut he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were\r\ntherefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and\r\nnaked papooses in their baskets hung from trees. \u201cDo you believe?\u201d he cried. Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate. She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she\r\nwasn\u2019t sure. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked Peter. \u201cIf you believe,\u201d he shouted to them, \u201cclap your hands;\r\ndon\u2019t let Tink die.\u201d Many clapped. Some didn\u2019t. A few beasts hissed. The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their\r\nnurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved. First\r\nher voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing\r\nthrough the room more merry and impudent than ever. She never thought of\r\nthanking those who believed, but she would have liked to get at the ones who\r\nhad hissed. \u201cAnd now to rescue Wendy!\u201d The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirt\r\nwith weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It\r\nwas not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not\r\nfar from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in\r\nthat fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow\r\nthrough the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he\r\nwas astir. He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names\r\nthat they are very wild and difficult of approach. There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which\r\nhappily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not be sure that\r\nthe children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated\r\nall footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space\r\nNature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had taught the children\r\nsomething of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and\r\nTinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget\r\nit. Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance,\r\nCurly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some\r\nimportant place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he\r\ncould not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help. The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not a\r\nmovement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or\r\nstalking him from behind. He swore this terrible oath: \u201cHook or me this time.\u201d Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across a space\r\non which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his dagger at the\r\nready. He was frightfully happy.",
  "Chapter XIV": "Chapter XIV. THE PIRATE SHIP One green light squinting over Kidd\u2019s Creek, which is near the mouth of\r\nthe pirate river, marked where the brig, the Jolly Roger , lay, low in\r\nthe water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her\r\ndetestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the cannibal of\r\nthe seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in the\r\nhorror of her name. She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could\r\nhave reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save the\r\nwhir of the ship\u2019s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and\r\nobliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he was\r\nso infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware\r\nof it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more\r\nthan once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook\u2019s tears and\r\nmade it flow. Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite\r\nunconscious. A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of the\r\nnight; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the\r\nexhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where\r\neven in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of\r\nHook\u2019s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing. Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph.\r\nPeter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were in\r\nthe brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days when\r\nhe had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is\r\nman, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by\r\nthe winds of his success? But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of his\r\nsombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected. He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of\r\nthe night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This inscrutable man never\r\nfelt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. They were socially inferior\r\nto him. Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date\r\nset the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must\r\nalready have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditions\r\nstill clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned.\r\nThus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in\r\nwhich he grappled her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school\u2019s\r\ndistinguished slouch. But above all he retained the passion for good form. Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this is all\r\nthat really matters. From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through them\r\ncame a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep.\r\n\u201cHave you been good form to-day?\u201d was their eternal question. \u201cFame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,\u201d he cried. \u201cIs it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?\u201d the\r\ntap-tap from his school replied. \u201cI am the only man whom Barbecue feared,\u201d he urged, \u201cand\r\nFlint feared Barbecue.\u201d \u201cBarbecue, Flint\u2014what house?\u201d came the cutting retort. Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about good\r\nform? His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper than\r\nthe iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallow\r\ncountenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his\r\nface, but there was no damming that trickle. Ah, envy not Hook. There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as if\r\nPeter\u2019s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire to\r\nmake his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it. \u201cBetter for Hook,\u201d he cried, \u201cif he had had less\r\nambition!\u201d It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself\r\nin the third person. \u201cNo little children to love me!\u201d Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him before;\r\nperhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he muttered to\r\nhimself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under the conviction that\r\nall children feared him. Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that night who\r\ndid not already love him. He had said horrid things to them and hit them with\r\nthe palm of his hand, because he could not hit with his fist, but they had only\r\nclung to him the more. Michael had tried on his spectacles. To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it, but it\r\nseemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his mind: why do they\r\nfind Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was. If\r\nSmee was lovable, what was it that made him so? A terrible answer suddenly\r\npresented itself\u2014\u201cGood form?\u201d Had the bo\u2019sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of\r\nall? He remembered that you have to prove you don\u2019t know you have it before\r\nyou are eligible for Pop. With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee\u2019s head; but he did\r\nnot tear. What arrested him was this reflection: \u201cTo claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?\u201d \u201cBad form!\u201d The unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward like a cut\r\nflower. His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed;\r\nand they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to his feet at\r\nonce, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passed\r\nover him. \u201cQuiet, you scugs,\u201d he cried, \u201cor I\u2019ll cast anchor in\r\nyou;\u201d and at once the din was hushed. \u201cAre all the children\r\nchained, so that they cannot fly away?\u201d \u201cAy, ay.\u201d \u201cThen hoist them up.\u201d The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy, and ranged\r\nin line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence. He\r\nlolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, and\r\nfingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch\r\nof colour to his face. \u201cNow then, bullies,\u201d he said briskly, \u201csix of you walk the\r\nplank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to\r\nbe?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t irritate him unnecessarily,\u201d had been Wendy\u2019s\r\ninstructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated\r\nthe idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be\r\nprudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhat\r\nsilly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. All\r\nchildren know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constant\r\nuse of it. So Tootles explained prudently, \u201cYou see, sir, I don\u2019t think my\r\nmother would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,\r\nSlightly?\u201d He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, \u201cI don\u2019t think\r\nso,\u201d as if he wished things had been otherwise. \u201cWould your mother\r\nlike you to be a pirate, Twin?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said the first twin, as clever as the\r\nothers. \u201cNibs, would\u2014\u201d \u201cStow this gab,\u201d roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.\r\n\u201cYou, boy,\u201d he said, addressing John, \u201cyou look as if you had\r\na little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?\u201d Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and he was\r\nstruck by Hook\u2019s picking him out. \u201cI once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,\u201d he said\r\ndiffidently. \u201cAnd a good name too. We\u2019ll call you that here, bully, if you\r\njoin.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think, Michael?\u201d asked John. \u201cWhat would you call me if I join?\u201d Michael demanded. \u201cBlackbeard Joe.\u201d Michael was naturally impressed. \u201cWhat do you think, John?\u201d He\r\nwanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide. \u201cShall we still be respectful subjects of the King?\u201d John inquired. Through Hook\u2019s teeth came the answer: \u201cYou would have to swear,\r\n\u2018Down with the King.\u2019\u201d Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now. \u201cThen I refuse,\u201d he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook. \u201cAnd I refuse,\u201d cried Michael. \u201cRule Britannia!\u201d squeaked Curly. The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,\r\n\u201cThat seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.\u201d They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing\r\nthe fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up. No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the boys\r\nthere was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she saw was\r\nthat the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on the\r\ngrimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger \u201cDirty\r\npig\u201d; and she had already written it on several. But as the boys gathered\r\nround her she had no thought, of course, save for them. \u201cSo, my beauty,\u201d said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, \u201cyou are\r\nto see your children walk the plank.\u201d Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled his\r\nruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture he\r\ntried to hide it, but he was too late. \u201cAre they to die?\u201d asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful\r\ncontempt that he nearly fainted. \u201cThey are,\u201d he snarled. \u201cSilence all,\u201d he called\r\ngloatingly, \u201cfor a mother\u2019s last words to her children.\u201d At this moment Wendy was grand. \u201cThese are my last words, dear\r\nboys,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI feel that I have a message to you from\r\nyour real mothers, and it is this: \u2018We hope our sons will die like\r\nEnglish gentlemen.\u2019\u201d Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, \u201cI am\r\ngoing to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?\u201d \u201cWhat my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?\u201d \u201cWhat my mother hopes. John, what are\u2014\u201d But Hook had found his voice again. \u201cTie her up!\u201d he shouted. It was Smee who tied her to the mast. \u201cSee here, honey,\u201d he\r\nwhispered, \u201cI\u2019ll save you if you promise to be my mother.\u201d But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. \u201cI would almost\r\nrather have no children at all,\u201d she said disdainfully. It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the\r\nmast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were about\r\nto take. They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, for\r\nthe capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only. Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy. His\r\nintention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the\r\nplank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguish\r\nhe hoped to wring from her. He heard something else instead. It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile. They all heard it\u2014pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was\r\nblown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward\r\nHook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone, and that from\r\nbeing actors they were suddenly become spectators. Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if he had\r\nbeen clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap. The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought,\r\n\u201cThe crocodile is about to board the ship!\u201d Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part\r\nof what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any other man\r\nwould have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain of\r\nHook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along\r\nthe deck as far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared\r\na passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that\r\nhe spoke. \u201cHide me!\u201d he cried hoarsely. They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming\r\naboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate. Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys\r\nso that they could rush to the ship\u2019s side to see the crocodile climbing\r\nit. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was no\r\ncrocodile that was coming to their aid. It was Peter. He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse\r\nsuspicion. Then he went on ticking.",
  "Chapter XV": "Chapter XV. \u201cHOOK OR ME THIS TIME\u201d Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for\r\na time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discover\r\nthat we have been deaf in one ear for we don\u2019t know how long, but, say,\r\nhalf an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to Peter. When last we\r\nsaw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his\r\ndagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing\r\nanything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered that it had not been\r\nticking. At first he thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the\r\nclock had run down. Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature\r\nthus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how he\r\ncould turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild\r\nbeasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He\r\nticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those\r\nwho heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of\r\nregaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was\r\nagain ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a\r\nfixed idea, it was a stupid beast. Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs\r\nencountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element.\r\nThus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know.\r\nAs he swam he had but one thought: \u201cHook or me this time.\u201d He had\r\nticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing\r\nit. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the\r\ntick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him. On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and\r\nhe was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as\r\nabject as if he had heard the crocodile. The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking. At\r\nfirst he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he looked behind\r\nhim swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it himself, and in a flash he\r\nunderstood the situation. \u201cHow clever of me!\u201d he thought at once,\r\nand signed to the boys not to burst into applause. It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the\r\nforecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by your\r\nwatch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the ill-fated\r\npirate\u2019s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward. Four boys\r\ncaught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was cast\r\noverboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How long has it taken? \u201cOne!\u201d (Slightly had begun to count.) None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin; for\r\nmore than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round. They could hear\r\neach other\u2019s distressed breathing now, which showed them that the more\r\nterrible sound had passed. \u201cIt\u2019s gone, captain,\u201d Smee said, wiping off his spectacles.\r\n\u201cAll\u2019s still again.\u201d Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently that he\r\ncould have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and he drew\r\nhimself up firmly to his full height. \u201cThen here\u2019s to Johnny Plank!\u201d he cried brazenly, hating the\r\nboys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the\r\nvillainous ditty: \u201cYo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0You walks along it so, Till it goes down and you goes down \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0To Davy Jones below!\u201d To terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, he\r\ndanced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he sang; and when he\r\nfinished he cried, \u201cDo you want a touch of the cat before you walk the\r\nplank?\u201d At that they fell on their knees. \u201cNo, no!\u201d they cried so piteously\r\nthat every pirate smiled. \u201cFetch the cat, Jukes,\u201d said Hook; \u201cit\u2019s in the\r\ncabin.\u201d The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other. \u201cAy, ay,\u201d said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They\r\nfollowed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song,\r\nhis dogs joining in with him: \u201cYo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat, \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Its tails are nine, you know, And when they\u2019re writ upon your back\u2014\u201d What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed\r\nby a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship, and died\r\naway. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but\r\nto the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d cried Hook. \u201cTwo,\u201d said Slightly solemnly. The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin. He\r\ntottered out, haggard. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?\u201d hissed Hook,\r\ntowering over him. \u201cThe matter wi\u2019 him is he\u2019s dead, stabbed,\u201d replied\r\nCecco in a hollow voice. \u201cBill Jukes dead!\u201d cried the startled pirates. \u201cThe cabin\u2019s as black as a pit,\u201d Cecco said, almost\r\ngibbering, \u201cbut there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard\r\ncrowing.\u201d The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seen\r\nby Hook. \u201cCecco,\u201d he said in his most steely voice, \u201cgo back and fetch\r\nme out that doodle-doo.\u201d Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying \u201cNo,\r\nno\u201d; but Hook was purring to his claw. \u201cDid you say you would go, Cecco?\u201d he said musingly. Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more singing,\r\nall listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a crow. No one spoke except Slightly. \u201cThree,\u201d he said. Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. \u201c\u2019S\u2019death and odds\r\nfish,\u201d he thundered, \u201cwho is to bring me that doodle-doo?\u201d \u201cWait till Cecco comes out,\u201d growled Starkey, and the others took\r\nup the cry. \u201cI think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,\u201d said Hook, purring again. \u201cNo, by thunder!\u201d Starkey cried. \u201cMy hook thinks you did,\u201d said Hook, crossing to him. \u201cI\r\nwonder if it would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll swing before I go in there,\u201d replied Starkey doggedly,\r\nand again he had the support of the crew. \u201cIs this mutiny?\u201d asked Hook more pleasantly than ever.\r\n\u201cStarkey\u2019s ringleader!\u201d \u201cCaptain, mercy!\u201d Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now. \u201cShake hands, Starkey,\u201d said Hook, proffering his claw. Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up Hook\r\nadvanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing scream the\r\npirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea. \u201cFour,\u201d said Slightly. \u201cAnd now,\u201d Hook said courteously, \u201cdid any other gentlemen\r\nsay mutiny?\u201d Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing\r\ngesture, \u201cI\u2019ll bring out that doodle-doo myself,\u201d he said,\r\nand sped into the cabin. \u201cFive.\u201d How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be\r\nready, but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern. \u201cSomething blew out the light,\u201d he said a little unsteadily. \u201cSomething!\u201d echoed Mullins. \u201cWhat of Cecco?\u201d demanded Noodler. \u201cHe\u2019s as dead as Jukes,\u201d said Hook shortly. His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably, and the\r\nmutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and Cookson\r\ncried, \u201cThey do say the surest sign a ship\u2019s accurst is when\r\nthere\u2019s one on board more than can be accounted for.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d muttered Mullins, \u201che always boards the\r\npirate craft last. Had he a tail, captain?\u201d \u201cThey say,\u201d said another, looking viciously at Hook, \u201cthat\r\nwhen he comes it\u2019s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.\u201d \u201cHad he a hook, captain?\u201d asked Cookson insolently; and one after\r\nanother took up the cry, \u201cThe ship\u2019s doomed!\u201d At this the\r\nchildren could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his\r\nprisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again. \u201cLads,\u201d he cried to his crew, \u201cnow here\u2019s a notion.\r\nOpen the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their\r\nlives. If they kill him, we\u2019re so much the better; if he kills them,\r\nwe\u2019re none the worse.\u201d For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his bidding.\r\nThe boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was\r\nclosed on them. \u201cNow, listen!\u201d cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to\r\nface the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.\r\nIt was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for the\r\nreappearance of Peter. She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had\r\ngone in search: the key that would free the children of their manacles, and now\r\nthey all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they could find. First signing\r\nthem to hide, Peter cut Wendy\u2019s bonds, and then nothing could have been\r\neasier than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the way, an\r\noath, \u201cHook or me this time.\u201d So when he had freed Wendy, he\r\nwhispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and himself took her\r\nplace by the mast, her cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he\r\ntook a great breath and crowed. To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin;\r\nand they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs he\r\nhad made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyes\r\noff them now they would leap at him. \u201cLads,\u201d he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never\r\nquailing for an instant, \u201cI\u2019ve thought it out. There\u2019s a\r\nJonah aboard.\u201d \u201cAy,\u201d they snarled, \u201ca man wi\u2019 a hook.\u201d \u201cNo, lads, no, it\u2019s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship\r\nwi\u2019 a woman on board. We\u2019ll right the ship when she\u2019s\r\ngone.\u201d Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint\u2019s.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth trying,\u201d they said doubtfully. \u201cFling the girl overboard,\u201d cried Hook; and they made a rush at the\r\nfigure in the cloak. \u201cThere\u2019s none can save you now, missy,\u201d Mullins hissed\r\njeeringly. \u201cThere\u2019s one,\u201d replied the figure. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cPeter Pan the avenger!\u201d came the terrible answer; and as he spoke\r\nPeter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who \u2019twas that had been\r\nundoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.\r\nIn that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke. At last he cried, \u201cCleave him to the brisket!\u201d but without\r\nconviction. \u201cDown, boys, and at them!\u201d Peter\u2019s voice rang out; and in\r\nanother moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the\r\npirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset\r\ncame when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking\r\nwildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man they\r\nwere the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled the\r\nboys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt\r\ninto the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly,\r\nwho did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their\r\nfaces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking\r\nswords of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of\r\nweapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously\r\ncounting\u2014five\u2014six\u2014seven\u2014eight\u2014nine\u2014ten\u2014eleven. I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemed\r\nto have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. They had\r\ndone for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Again\r\nand again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. He\r\nhad lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler, when\r\nanother, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray. \u201cPut up your swords, boys,\u201d cried the newcomer, \u201cthis man is\r\nmine.\u201d Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others drew back\r\nand formed a ring around them. For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and\r\nPeter with the strange smile upon his face. \u201cSo, Pan,\u201d said Hook at last, \u201cthis is all your doing.\u201d \u201cAy, James Hook,\u201d came the stern answer, \u201cit is all my\r\ndoing.\u201d \u201cProud and insolent youth,\u201d said Hook, \u201cprepare to meet thy\r\ndoom.\u201d \u201cDark and sinister man,\u201d Peter answered, \u201chave at\r\nthee.\u201d Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to\r\neither blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity;\r\never and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe\u2019s\r\ndefence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive\r\nthe steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so\r\nnimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hoping\r\nsuddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at\r\nRio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again.\r\nThen he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this\r\ntime had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,\r\npierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour,\r\nyou remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook\u2019s hand, and\r\nhe was at Peter\u2019s mercy. \u201cNow!\u201d cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter\r\ninvited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a\r\ntragic feeling that Peter was showing good form. Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicions\r\nassailed him now. \u201cPan, who and what art thou?\u201d he cried huskily. \u201cI\u2019m youth, I\u2019m joy,\u201d Peter answered at a venture,\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bird that has broken out of the egg.\u201d This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter\r\ndid not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of\r\ngood form. \u201cTo\u2019t again,\u201d he cried despairingly. He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would\r\nhave severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter fluttered\r\nround him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone. And\r\nagain and again he darted in and pricked. Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked for\r\nlife; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was cold\r\nforever. Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it. \u201cIn two minutes,\u201d he cried, \u201cthe ship will be blown to\r\npieces.\u201d Now, now, he thought, true form will show. But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands, and\r\ncalmly flung it overboard. What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was, we may\r\nbe glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was true to the\r\ntraditions of his race. The other boys were flying around him now, flouting,\r\nscornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, his\r\nmind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long\r\nago, or being sent up for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.\r\nAnd his shoes were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right,\r\nand his socks were right. James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell. For we have come to his last moment. Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he\r\nsprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that the\r\ncrocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that this\r\nknowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end. He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he stood on\r\nthe bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, he\r\ninvited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab. At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved. \u201cBad form,\u201d he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile. Thus perished James Hook. \u201cSeventeen,\u201d Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his\r\nfigures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reached\r\nthe shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him nurse for all\r\ntheir papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforth\r\nwandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living by\r\nsaying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared. Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching\r\nPeter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominent\r\nagain. She praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed\r\nher the place where he had killed one; and then she took them into Hook\u2019s\r\ncabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail. It said\r\n\u201chalf-past one!\u201d The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got them to\r\nbed in the pirates\u2019 bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter,\r\nwho strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell asleep by the side\r\nof Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for a\r\nlong time, and Wendy held him tightly.",
  "Chapter XVI": "Chapter XVI. THE RETURN HOME By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for there was\r\na big sea running; and Tootles, the bo\u2019sun, was among them, with a\r\nrope\u2019s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned pirate\r\nclothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the true\r\nnautical roll and hitching their trousers. It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and second\r\nmate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the mast, and lived\r\nin the fo\u2019c\u2019sle. Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; but\r\nhe piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he hoped they\r\nwould do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the scum\r\nof Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would tear them. The\r\nbluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him\r\nlustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round,\r\nand nosed her for the mainland. Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship\u2019s chart, that if this\r\nweather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June, after\r\nwhich it would save time to fly. Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of\r\nkeeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they dared not\r\nexpress their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant obedience was the\r\nonly safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take\r\nsoundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull\r\nWendy\u2019s suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit\r\nwas ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of some of\r\nHook\u2019s wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among them that on\r\nthe first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook\u2019s\r\ncigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger,\r\nwhich he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook. Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that desolate home\r\nfrom which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. It\r\nseems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be sure\r\nthat Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we had returned sooner to look with\r\nsorrowful sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, \u201cDon\u2019t be\r\nsilly; what do I matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children.\u201d So\r\nlong as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; and\r\nthey may lay to that. Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful\r\noccupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them\r\nto see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not\r\ngo out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why on earth should their\r\nbeds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry?\r\nWould it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their\r\nparents were spending the week-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson\r\nthey have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in\r\nthis way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us. One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the way\r\nauthors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be here\r\non Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy\r\nand John and Michael are looking forward. They have been planning it out on the\r\nship: mother\u2019s rapture, father\u2019s shout of joy, Nana\u2019s leap\r\nthrough the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared for\r\nis a good hiding. How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in\r\nadvance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy\r\nher mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, \u201cDash it all, here are\r\nthose boys again.\u201d However, we should get no thanks even for this. We are\r\nbeginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would\r\nupbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure. \u201cBut, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by\r\ntelling you what\u2019s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.\u201d \u201cYes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of\r\ndelight.\u201d \u201cOh, if you look at it in that way!\u201d \u201cWhat other way is there in which to look at it?\u201d You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say extraordinarily\r\nnice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of them will I say now.\r\nShe does not really need to be told to have things ready, for they are ready.\r\nAll the beds are aired, and she never leaves the house, and observe, the window\r\nis open. For all the use we are to her, we might well go back to the ship.\r\nHowever, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are,\r\nlookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in\r\nthe hope that some of them will hurt. The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six\r\nthe kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr. Darling felt in\r\nhis bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up, and that from\r\nfirst to last she had been wiser than he. Of course, as we have seen, he was\r\nquite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been\r\nable to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a\r\nlion\u2019s courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought the\r\nmatter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on\r\nall fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling\u2019s dear\r\ninvitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly: \u201cNo, my own one, this is the place for me.\u201d In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel\r\nuntil his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr.\r\nDarling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave up doing it. And\r\nthere never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling, as he sat\r\nin the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all\r\ntheir pretty ways. Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into the\r\nkennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly. Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab, which\r\nconveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way at six.\r\nSomething of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember\r\nhow sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose every\r\nmovement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he must have suffered\r\ntorture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his\r\nlittle home, and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked\r\ninside. It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning of\r\nit leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched. Crowds followed\r\nthe cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph;\r\ninterviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited him to\r\ndinner and added, \u201cDo come in the kennel.\u201d On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting\r\nGeorge\u2019s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look at her\r\nclosely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now just\r\nbecause she has lost her babes, I find I won\u2019t be able to say nasty\r\nthings about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children, she\r\ncouldn\u2019t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep.\r\nThe corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her hand\r\nmoves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peter\r\nbest, and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make her\r\nhappy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They are\r\nreally within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need\r\nwhisper is that they are on the way. Let\u2019s. It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and there\r\nis no one in the room but Nana. \u201cO Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.\u201d Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her\r\nmistress\u2019s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was\r\nbrought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see that\r\nhis face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression. He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no imagination,\r\nand was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man. Outside,\r\nthe crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and he was\r\nnaturally not unmoved. \u201cListen to them,\u201d he said; \u201cit is very gratifying.\u201d \u201cLots of little boys,\u201d sneered Liza. \u201cThere were several adults to-day,\u201d he assured her with a faint\r\nflush; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.\r\nSocial success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some time he\r\nsat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling of this success,\r\nand pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not\r\nbe turned by it. \u201cBut if I had been a weak man,\u201d he said. \u201cGood heavens, if I\r\nhad been a weak man!\u201d \u201cAnd, George,\u201d she said timidly, \u201cyou are as full of remorse\r\nas ever, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cFull of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a\r\nkennel.\u201d \u201cBut it is punishment, isn\u2019t it, George? You are sure you are not\r\nenjoying it?\u201d \u201cMy love!\u201d You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he curled\r\nround in the kennel. \u201cWon\u2019t you play me to sleep,\u201d he asked, \u201con the nursery\r\npiano?\u201d and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added\r\nthoughtlessly, \u201cAnd shut that window. I feel a draught.\u201d \u201cO George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open\r\nfor them, always, always.\u201d Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery and\r\nplayed, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John and Michael\r\nflew into the room. Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement planned\r\nby them before we left the ship; but something must have happened since then,\r\nfor it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell. Peter\u2019s first words tell all. \u201cQuick Tink,\u201d he whispered, \u201cclose the window; bar it!\r\nThat\u2019s right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy\r\ncomes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go\r\nback with me.\u201d Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated\r\nthe pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the\r\nchildren to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time. Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he\r\npeeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink,\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Wendy\u2019s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty\r\nas my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my\r\nmother\u2019s was.\u201d Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes bragged\r\nabout her. He did not know the tune, which was \u201cHome, Sweet Home,\u201d but he knew\r\nit was saying, \u201cCome back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy\u201d; and he cried\r\nexultantly, \u201cYou will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is\r\nbarred!\u201d He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw that Mrs.\r\nDarling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on her\r\neyes. \u201cShe wants me to unbar the window,\u201d thought Peter, \u201cbut I\r\nwon\u2019t, not I!\u201d He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken their\r\nplace. \u201cShe\u2019s awfully fond of Wendy,\u201d he said to himself. He was\r\nangry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy. The reason was so simple: \u201cI\u2019m fond of her too. We can\u2019t both\r\nhave her, lady.\u201d But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He ceased to\r\nlook at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He skipped about and\r\nmade funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him,\r\nknocking. \u201cOh, all right,\u201d he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the\r\nwindow. \u201cCome on, Tink,\u201d he cried, with a frightful sneer at the\r\nlaws of nature; \u201cwe don\u2019t want any silly mothers;\u201d and he\r\nflew away. Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, which\r\nof course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the floor, quite\r\nunashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten his home. \u201cJohn,\u201d he said, looking around him doubtfully, \u201cI think I\r\nhave been here before.\u201d \u201cOf course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d Michael said, but not with much conviction. \u201cI say,\u201d cried John, \u201cthe kennel!\u201d and he dashed across\r\nto look into it. \u201cPerhaps Nana is inside it,\u201d Wendy said. But John whistled. \u201cHullo,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a man\r\ninside it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s father!\u201d exclaimed Wendy. \u201cLet me see father,\u201d Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good\r\nlook. \u201cHe is not so big as the pirate I killed,\u201d he said with such\r\nfrank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been\r\nsad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say. Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the\r\nkennel. \u201cSurely,\u201d said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory,\r\n\u201che used not to sleep in the kennel?\u201d \u201cJohn,\u201d Wendy said falteringly, \u201cperhaps we don\u2019t\r\nremember the old life as well as we thought we did.\u201d A chill fell upon them; and serve them right. \u201cIt is very careless of mother,\u201d said that young scoundrel John,\r\n\u201cnot to be here when we come back.\u201d It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again. \u201cIt\u2019s mother!\u201d cried Wendy, peeping. \u201cSo it is!\u201d said John. \u201cThen are you not really our mother, Wendy?\u201d asked Michael, who was\r\nsurely sleepy. \u201cOh dear!\u201d exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse,\r\n\u201cit was quite time we came back.\u201d \u201cLet us creep in,\u201d John suggested, \u201cand put our hands over\r\nher eyes.\u201d But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had a\r\nbetter plan. \u201cLet us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as\r\nif we had never been away.\u201d And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband\r\nwas asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for her cry of joy,\r\nbut it did not come. She saw them, but she did not believe they were there. You\r\nsee, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this\r\nwas just the dream hanging around her still. She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had nursed\r\nthem. They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of\r\nthem. \u201cMother!\u201d Wendy cried. \u201cThat\u2019s Wendy,\u201d she said, but still she was sure it was the\r\ndream. \u201cMother!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s John,\u201d she said. \u201cMother!\u201d cried Michael. He knew her now. \u201cThat\u2019s Michael,\u201d she said, and she stretched out her arms\r\nfor the three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they\r\ndid, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed and\r\nrun to her. \u201cGeorge, George!\u201d she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling\r\nwoke to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been a\r\nlovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was\r\nstaring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children\r\ncan never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which\r\nhe must be for ever barred.",
  "Chapter XVII": "Chapter XVII. WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting below\r\nto give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five\r\nhundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought this\r\nwould make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling,\r\nwith their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes.\r\nThey said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have\r\nlooked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him. Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr. Darling\r\nwas curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather large\r\nnumber. \u201cI must say,\u201d he said to Wendy, \u201cthat you don\u2019t do\r\nthings by halves,\u201d a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed\r\nat them. The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, \u201cDo you think\r\nwe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go away.\u201d \u201cFather!\u201d Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He\r\nknew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it. \u201cWe could lie doubled up,\u201d said Nibs. \u201cI always cut their hair myself,\u201d said Wendy. \u201cGeorge!\u201d Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one\r\nshowing himself in such an unfavourable light. Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to have them\r\nas she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his consent as well\r\nas hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his own house. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is a cypher,\u201d Tootles cried instantly.\r\n\u201cDo you think he is a cypher, Curly?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?\u201d \u201cRather not. Twin, what do you think?\u201d It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was absurdly\r\ngratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if\r\nthey fitted in. \u201cWe\u2019ll fit in, sir,\u201d they assured him. \u201cThen follow the leader,\u201d he cried gaily. \u201cMind you, I am not\r\nsure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it\u2019s all\r\nthe same. Hoop la!\u201d He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried \u201cHoop\r\nla!\u201d and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget\r\nwhether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted\r\nin. As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not exactly\r\ncome to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open\r\nit if she liked and call to him. That is what she did. \u201cHullo, Wendy, good-bye,\u201d he said. \u201cOh dear, are you going away?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t feel, Peter,\u201d she said falteringly, \u201cthat\r\nyou would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAbout me, Peter?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on\r\nWendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys, and would like\r\nto adopt him also. \u201cWould you send me to school?\u201d he inquired craftily. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd then to an office?\u201d \u201cI suppose so.\u201d \u201cSoon I would be a man?\u201d \u201cVery soon.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to school and learn solemn things,\u201d he\r\ntold her passionately. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a man. O Wendy\u2019s\r\nmother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!\u201d \u201cPeter,\u201d said Wendy the comforter, \u201cI should love you in a\r\nbeard;\u201d and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed\r\nher. \u201cKeep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.\u201d \u201cBut where are you going to live?\u201d \u201cWith Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it\r\nhigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.\u201d \u201cHow lovely,\u201d cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened\r\nher grip. \u201cI thought all the fairies were dead,\u201d Mrs. Darling said. \u201cThere are always a lot of young ones,\u201d explained Wendy, who was\r\nnow quite an authority, \u201cbecause you see when a new baby laughs for the\r\nfirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are\r\nalways new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve ones\r\nare boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little\r\nsillies who are not sure what they are.\u201d \u201cI shall have such fun,\u201d said Peter, with eye on Wendy. \u201cIt will be rather lonely in the evening,\u201d she said, \u201csitting\r\nby the fire.\u201d \u201cI shall have Tink.\u201d \u201cTink can\u2019t go a twentieth part of the way round,\u201d she\r\nreminded him a little tartly. \u201cSneaky tell-tale!\u201d Tink called out from somewhere round the\r\ncorner. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Peter said. \u201cO Peter, you know it matters.\u201d \u201cWell, then, come with me to the little house.\u201d \u201cMay I, mummy?\u201d \u201cCertainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.\u201d \u201cBut he does so need a mother.\u201d \u201cSo do you, my love.\u201d \u201cOh, all right,\u201d Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness\r\nmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsome\r\noffer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning.\r\nWendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her\r\nthat spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay\r\nagain. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have\r\ntold you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because\r\nWendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones: \u201cYou won\u2019t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time\r\ncomes?\u201d Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling\u2019s\r\nkiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily.\r\nFunny. But she seemed satisfied. Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, but\r\nSlightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top\r\nclass. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been\r\nnot to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settled\r\ndown to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have to\r\nsay that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to\r\nthe bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their\r\ndiversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased\r\nto tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let\r\ngo of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of\r\npractice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer\r\nbelieved. Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he\r\nwas with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flew\r\naway with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the\r\nNeverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become;\r\nbut he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself. She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but new\r\nadventures had crowded the old ones from his mind. \u201cWho is Captain Hook?\u201d he asked with interest when she spoke of the\r\narch enemy. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember,\u201d she asked, amazed, \u201chow you\r\nkilled him and saved all our lives?\u201d \u201cI forget them after I kill them,\u201d he replied carelessly. When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he\r\nsaid, \u201cWho is Tinker Bell?\u201d \u201cO Peter,\u201d she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could\r\nnot remember. \u201cThere are such a lot of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect she is no\r\nmore.\u201d I expect he was right, for fairies don\u2019t live long, but they are so\r\nlittle that a short time seems a good while to them. Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter;\r\nit had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was exactly as\r\nfascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house\r\non the tree tops. Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the old\r\none simply would not meet; but he never came. \u201cPerhaps he is ill,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYou know he is never ill.\u201d Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, \u201cPerhaps there is\r\nno such person, Wendy!\u201d and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had\r\nnot been crying. Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never knew\r\nhe had missed a year. That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer she\r\ntried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to\r\nhim when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went\r\nwithout bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married\r\nwoman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she\r\nhad kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was\r\none of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free\r\nwill a day quicker than other girls. All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth\r\nwhile saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly\r\nany day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michael\r\nis an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord.\r\nYou see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be\r\nTootles. The bearded man who doesn\u2019t know any story to tell his children\r\nwas once John. Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think that Peter\r\ndid not alight in the church and forbid the banns. Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be written\r\nin ink but in a golden splash. She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the\r\nmoment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she was\r\nold enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of\r\nPeter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which\r\nthe famous flight had taken place. It was Jane\u2019s nursery now, for her\r\nfather had bought it at the three per cents from Wendy\u2019s father, who was\r\nno longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten. There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane\u2019s and her\r\nnurse\u2019s; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died\r\nof old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being\r\nvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except\r\nherself. Once a week Jane\u2019s nurse had her evening off; and then it was\r\nWendy\u2019s part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was\r\nJane\u2019s invention to raise the sheet over her mother\u2019s head and her\r\nown, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper: \u201cWhat do we see now?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I see anything to-night,\u201d says Wendy, with a\r\nfeeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation. \u201cYes, you do,\u201d says Jane, \u201cyou see when you were a little\r\ngirl.\u201d \u201cThat is a long time ago, sweetheart,\u201d says Wendy. \u201cAh me,\r\nhow time flies!\u201d \u201cDoes it fly,\u201d asks the artful child, \u201cthe way you flew when\r\nyou were a little girl?\u201d \u201cThe way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever did\r\nreally fly.\u201d \u201cYes, you did.\u201d \u201cThe dear old days when I could fly!\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t you fly now, mother?\u201d \u201cBecause I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the\r\nway.\u201d \u201cWhy do they forget the way?\u201d \u201cBecause they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only\r\nthe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.\u201d \u201cWhat is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and\r\ninnocent and heartless.\u201d Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something. \u201cI do believe,\u201d she says, \u201cthat it is this nursery.\u201d \u201cI do believe it is,\u201d says Jane. \u201cGo on.\u201d They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in\r\nlooking for his shadow. \u201cThe foolish fellow,\u201d says Wendy, \u201ctried to stick it on with\r\nsoap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for\r\nhim.\u201d \u201cYou have missed a bit,\u201d interrupts Jane, who now knows the story\r\nbetter than her mother. \u201cWhen you saw him sitting on the floor crying,\r\nwhat did you say?\u201d \u201cI sat up in bed and I said, \u2018Boy, why are you\r\ncrying?\u2019\u201d \u201cYes, that was it,\u201d says Jane, with a big breath. \u201cAnd then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the\r\npirates and the redskins and the mermaids\u2019 lagoon, and the home under the\r\nground, and the little house.\u201d \u201cYes! which did you like best of all?\u201d \u201cI think I liked the home under the ground best of all.\u201d \u201cYes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?\u201d \u201cThe last thing he ever said to me was, \u2018Just always be waiting for\r\nme, and then some night you will hear me crowing.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut, alas, he forgot all about me,\u201d Wendy said it with a smile.\r\nShe was as grown up as that. \u201cWhat did his crow sound like?\u201d Jane asked one evening. \u201cIt was like this,\u201d Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter\u2019s\r\ncrow. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jane said gravely, \u201cit was like\r\nthis;\u201d and she did it ever so much better than her mother. Wendy was a little startled. \u201cMy darling, how can you know?\u201d \u201cI often hear it when I am sleeping,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAh yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only\r\none who heard it awake.\u201d \u201cLucky you,\u201d said Jane. And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and the\r\nstory had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed. Wendy\r\nwas sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for\r\nthere was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a\r\ncrow. Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor. He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all\r\nhis first teeth. He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daring\r\nto move, helpless and guilty, a big woman. \u201cHullo, Wendy,\u201d he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\r\nthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might have\r\nbeen the nightgown in which he had seen her first. \u201cHullo, Peter,\u201d she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as\r\npossible. Something inside her was crying \u201cWoman, Woman, let go of\r\nme.\u201d \u201cHullo, where is John?\u201d he asked, suddenly missing the third bed. \u201cJohn is not here now,\u201d she gasped. \u201cIs Michael asleep?\u201d he asked, with a careless glance at Jane. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane\r\nas well as to Peter. \u201cThat is not Michael,\u201d she said quickly, lest a judgment should\r\nfall on her. Peter looked. \u201cHullo, is it a new one?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBoy or girl?\u201d \u201cGirl.\u201d Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it. \u201cPeter,\u201d she said, faltering, \u201care you expecting me to fly\r\naway with you?\u201d \u201cOf course; that is why I have come.\u201d He added a little sternly,\r\n\u201cHave you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?\u201d She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass. \u201cI can\u2019t come,\u201d she said apologetically, \u201cI have\r\nforgotten how to fly.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll soon teach you again.\u201d \u201cO Peter, don\u2019t waste the fairy dust on me.\u201d She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\nhe cried, shrinking. \u201cI will turn up the light,\u201d she said, \u201cand then you can see\r\nfor yourself.\u201d For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn up the light,\u201d he cried. She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girl\r\nheart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were\r\nwet-eyed smiles. Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and when\r\nthe tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back\r\nsharply. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he cried again. She had to tell him. \u201cI am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long\r\nago.\u201d \u201cYou promised not to!\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d \u201cYes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.\u201d \u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his\r\ndagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on the floor instead\r\nand sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could have\r\ndone it so easily once. She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the room\r\nto try to think. Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed, and was\r\ninterested at once. \u201cBoy,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy are you crying?\u201d Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed. \u201cHullo,\u201d he said. \u201cHullo,\u201d said Jane. \u201cMy name is Peter Pan,\u201d he told her. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d \u201cI came back for my mother,\u201d he explained, \u201cto take her to\r\nthe Neverland.\u201d \u201cYes, I know,\u201d Jane said, \u201cI have been waiting for\r\nyou.\u201d When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing\r\ngloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn\r\necstasy. \u201cShe is my mother,\u201d Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood\r\nby his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they\r\ngazed at him. \u201cHe does so need a mother,\u201d Jane said. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d Wendy admitted rather forlornly; \u201cno one knows\r\nit so well as I.\u201d \u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the\r\nshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about. Wendy rushed to the window. \u201cNo, no,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt is just for spring cleaning time,\u201d Jane said, \u201che wants\r\nme always to do his spring cleaning.\u201d \u201cIf only I could go with you,\u201d Wendy sighed. \u201cYou see you can\u2019t fly,\u201d said Jane. Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse of her\r\nshows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as\r\nsmall as stars. As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure\r\nlittle again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a common grown-up,\r\nwith a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he\r\nforgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she\r\ntells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret\r\ngrows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter\u2019s mother in turn;\r\nand thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate . While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support. Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org . This website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
